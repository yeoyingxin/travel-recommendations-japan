1koo697,"Last night in Kyoto, I joined a Japanese family for dinner by mistake. It was the greatest part of my trip.","Last night my wife was tired of walking all day and needed to rest her feet, so I went to dinner without her. I found a random restaurant on Tabelog and made my way to a small 8-seater restaurant. When I sat down, I was seated next to a group of 4 older locals, 2 couples (probably around 60-70) Shortly after I sat down, one of the people asked me where I was from in English. I told her I was from the US and she said, ‚Äúokay.‚Äù 

I continued eating and about 30 minutes in, one of the men in the group of 4 started showing his wife and 2 friends a picture of their cat. I couldn‚Äôt help but notice and chimed in, ‚Äúvery cute cat!‚Äù The man got so excited. He hardly spoke any English and I speak maybe 10 words of Japanese (thank you Duolingo) but we started chatting with what we could. One of the wives would also translate more in depth sentences. Turns out she was an English teacher before she retired. 

Next thing I know, this group is ordering sake for me, ordering sushi, steak, etc for the group and splitting it equally with me. We laughed, shared stories, and learned a lot about each other. They kept calling me friend. The dinner went from 6-10 PM and it was such an amazing time. Afterwards, they paid and got up to leave but first they asked to take pictures with me and one of the men added me on Instagram lol. As they were leaving, the man who sat closest to me said, via google translate, ‚Äúit has been a great pleasure to get to know you. I look forward to seeing you the next time you visit Kyoto.‚Äù Everyone gave me a handshake, we exchanges pleasantries, and they went on their way. 

I finished paying my bill, and as I finished, the group came back and asked me if I would join them for a drink at a local bar. I couldn‚Äôt say no, so we went to a bar and continued to tell more stories. After 6 hours with the group, we parted ways, again exchanging pleasantries. 

It was so moving to me that despite cultural differences, language barriers, and age differences (I‚Äôm 32), we were able to come together and share such a unique experience. I won‚Äôt post the pics out of respect of them, but I will say, they are pictures I‚Äôll cherish for the rest of my life. 

Editing this post because a lot of people are a curious on me leaving my wife behind: she had a pretty bad rash from the heat and all the walking and told me to go out and have a great time. The only ask was that I text her on my way back to the hotel to see if she was still awake because she wanted 7-11 lol. She loved the stories and was very happy I got to experience something like that. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1koo697/last_night_in_kyoto_i_joined_a_japanese_family/,That‚Äôs the essence of travel.,Mizu to gohan,"My wife and I walked into a random bar in Golden-gai a dozen years ago on our honeymoon trip. We sat and ordered our drinks and were just minding our own business in a small bar, when two mid-twenties Japanese salarywomen started talking to us. Chie knew decent English from a year abroad while Yuka barely spoke any English. All she could yell in her broken, drunken English was ""I want a Canadian boyfriend!"" (we're from Vancouver). Many drinks and hours past the last train later, we said our goodbyes while exchanging Facebook contacts. It felt like we had known each other for years. Little did we know, that this was just the start of an incredible friendship.

A few years later, we returned to visit Chie in another city where she now worked. We had dinner at a local restaurant which she kindly paid for, then invited us to her apartment to have some snacks and tea. Time got pretty late and she just said ""oh why don't you guys crash here?"" Having no other plans for the night we graciously accepted her offer. We woke up next morning and saw breakfast already prepared for us, and as it was a normal workday for her, she just told us to take our time and lock up whenever and leave the key in the mailbox.

But the story doesn't end there. We went back to Tokyo and visited Yuka during sakura season. She invited a few of her friends and we went hanami in Ueno park, and karaoke afterwards. Her English was still quite poor, though we could communicate as my Japanese is conversational and one of the friends spoke some English as well. We also visited her hometown and they showed us around, brought us to a pottery experience (we still have the bowls we made), and just had a great time overall. 

A few months later, Yuka contacted us and told us that she wanted to move to Vancouver! She chose our city because she knew we live here. Over the next few months, she would regularly Skype with my wife to practice her English, and when the time came, we housed her for a couple weeks until she found a place to stay. She went to English school here and improved her English massively over the next year or two. More importantly, she found her ""Canadian boyfriend"" (actually a Brazilian who was also here to study/work). They moved back to his home in Brazil during the pandemic and got married!

Eventually they would move back to Japan to her hometown, as they both work remotely for foreign companies. This past winter, as we and my parents had planned to visit Japan, she invited all of us to visit her family (now with a newborn baby!) in her parents old traditional house where we enjoyed a wonderful osechi lunch made by her mom (who would not stop cooking), while her dad proudly showed us pictures from his youth and had great conversations with my family (through translations of course).

Had we walked into another bar on that fateful night, all of our lives might have been very different, but to us, this is what travelling is all about, and for me, someone's who's been to Japan over 20 times, this is what I always tell everyone why Japan is the best, because of the people. In two months, I'm going to achieve my goal and will be visiting the last of all 47 prefectures. Many of my Japanese friends always marvel at how many places in Japan I've visited, but to me, there's never enough time and I'm still just scratching the surface.

Tldr: go to Japan.",That sounds so pleasant! I‚Äôm glad you had that experience :),

1ia388w,MISSING DISABLED USA CITIZEN IN TOKYO,"On January 25, 2025. my mentally disabled  uncle got on a train. We were about to board with him but the doors closed too fast. 

We have contacted the police and they told us that there is a nationwide search but every train station we have visited DONT know anything about it. We have filed a missing person's report.

He was last seen January 25 2025 at 20:15 pm at Shin Kiba station on Platform 1, heading to Maihama. Wearing a brown jacket with a hood.

He is 62 years old, about 5 feet 2 inches. He has a mustache. He is a diabetic and needs medication so this is very urgent!!! Please call the Uruyasa police station if you find him or have seen him since last night.

Do you think we should try contacting a news media or anyone else? The embassy does not open until tomorrow...we will appreciate any advice or happy stories üôèüèª

UPDATE: he has been found!!! This is his story.

He says he slept on the concrete floor last night. He had something to eat after a good samaritan saw him sitting in a Thai food restaurant 45 km away from our hotel! We were staying near Maihama Station and he got all the way to Saitama. The young man gave him 10k yen ($60 US) and he bought a coca cola and a sandwich but then he used the rest of the money on local busses trying to get home and that's why we couldn't find him at or near the train stations!

He's not in any pain or hurt physically. He told police that he was hungry but they couldn't feed him because there are strict laws against it in case of allergic reaction. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1ia388w/missing_disabled_usa_citizen_in_tokyo/,"

1d9o4y1,I accidentally bought a $1300 bottle of wine in Japan ,"We were in Japan for 30 days and had a few big ticket restaurants we wanted to visit. On our second day in Tokyo we went to Shima, near Ginza, known for their Wagyu beef. We had booked in advance, budgeted $500-$600 and brought cash -- it was meant to be one of our ballout experiences for our honeymoon. The steak was roughly $180 for 150g (but their shtick is to weigh it in front of you and it's always much over the listed weight). 

At the time, the Canadian dollar was an easy exchange -- you could just drop two zeros from the Yen and that was approximately what it was in Canadian. 3000 Yen = 30 CAD with quick math.

Here's the kicker -- I am a career server. I have some decent (but modest) wine knowledge including several accredited courses. I am mostly familiar with American wine and Italian wine. My husband let me pick the wine and I was interested in a Ch√¢teauneuf-du-Pape for $150 or a Bordeaux for $130. He was encouraging me to splurge on the Ch√¢teauneuf-du-Pape... it's our honeymoon afterall! I opted for the Bordeaux thinking it would be better with the meat; a 2014 Ch√¢teau Haut-Brion. The host kept coming over to us saying things like ""very special wine."" I was confused because I was like, lady, we already bought it... you don't need to sell it to us. It was incredible and I took a picture of the label, thinking this is really good for $130. Too good for $130, as it turns out.

We were seated at the bar where all the action happens, watching the old master sitting on a stool as he grills on his rotating skewer. It was pure magic. The man seated next to me was from Upper Eastside New York, joined by his family. His young children ordered more expensive steaks than we did. He too had a Bordeaux, albeit more modest than ours, I would come to learn. 

The experience and service was incredible. When people say Wagyu melts in your mouth, you never truly understand until you've had it. 11/10

At the end of the meal I went to the washroom while my husband got the bill. I came back and I could see a look of sheer terror on his face. The host had brought him the wine list and he was looking at the price of wine we ordered. 

We had missed a zero. What I thought was $130 was in fact, $1300. 

Thank God we didn't order the $1500 wine.

The host realized our mistake, all the staff realized our mistake, my buddy next to me now shied away from me as I said in a hail Mary ""we missed a zero!"" As if this rich newyorkan was gonna help us out. My husband desperately asked if credit card was ok, she said yes. She took the card and processed it, returning it to us and showing she had deducted $300 from the bill. Our food was almost entirely comped. 

Embarrassed and horrified, we quickly left. A chef stopped us on our way and handed us an entire cheesecake, to which I said ""we didn't order this!"" He forced it into my hands. 

Once outside, my husband and I made a pact to not be upset. We couldn't afford it, but we wouldn't let it ruin the rest of our *barely started* trip. We left and bought a pack of smokes at the nearest konbini. I don't smoke. 

When I returned to work a month later I told my sommelier about my blunder. He asked what wine cost you that much?! Welp, apparently I got a steal of a deal for that bottle. Because you can't get that house and vintage for anywhere near that price in Canada. Guess I've gotta brush up on my wine knowledge.

We are returning to Tokyo this fall and my dream is to go back to Shima for dinner and bring the receipt to show them the kindness they showed us by taking off $300 when it was clearly our mistake. But also to gift them some Canadian ice wine or something.



Edit: To clarify... We didn't know they comped us until after the fact. We thought we were paying for the entire bill, she took our credit card away and processed it. She returned and said she had subtracted 30000 yen. We didn't ask for nor wanted or expected any compensation for *our* mistake. 

I have also learned the receipt is not the move. Thanks for your feedback. We will likely just enjoy dinner there again if we can secure a reso and not mention the mishap at all. And after we've paid maybe a gift for them and the staff to say thanks for two lovely experiences.

Edit: spelling ",https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1d9o4y1/i_accidentally_bought_a_1300_bottle_of_wine_in/,"Reading this while i go on yakitori in Ameyokocho

Edit: forgot Highball","At least it seems like the place comped you and gave you some free stuff after. Could have been worse for sure. Thanks for sharing though that was interesting, what a great restaurant.",Damn that was the real strong zero,"> bring the receipt to show them the kindness they showed us by taking off $300 when it was clearly our mistake

I am not Japanese and welcome to be corrected, but wondering if this is a good idea as it can come across like rubbing a accommodative once-off kindness in their face. Pouring the staff a glass of the drink you ordered this time (i.e., buying them a drink from their place on your bill) may seem a little more appropriate.",
17y4i6q,"I just went into a taxi in Morioka and told the driver ""Omakase""","TL;DR at the bottom.

For those who don't know, Omakase means ""I'll leave it up to you"" and is used in restaurants to tell the chef to just give you whatever he thinks is best.

I am on a trip in Japan, currently in Morioka, and after finishing dinner at 18.30 they decided to go back to the hotel and do nothing for the rest of the evening.

Not me.

Since learning about Omakase, I have wanted to try doing it in a taxi, and just see where I'll end up. So I did just that. The driver was initially very confused, but after insisting I was serious, he asked me for a budget, and I told him 5000 yen, which he said would give 30 minutes. We went around Morioka, I told him what we saw earlier, and he ended up taking me to
Mitsuishi shrine, a shrine where a demon is supposedly sealed in the three giant rocks next to enough the shrine us built. He not only drive me there, but jumped out of the taxi to tell me about it.

Then he took me to Kaminohashi bridge, showed me the Giboshi pillars which are apparently 400 years old, and viewed as a local treasure. 

Then he drove me around a bit, just talking about local sights without getting out of the taxi, before deciding that although the time was up, he would show me Hachimangu shrine, free of charge.

All through this, Sashi-san, my 70 year old amazing taxi driver, is fighting to translate the things he wants to say into English, while I am just doing my best to put my terrible Japanese to good use. The ban was super passionate, and did his best to give me a great tour of the city despite the fact that I am going sightseeing at night (although many of the Shriners look super cool at night, so I have no regrets about it).

All in all an amazing experience, and it only cost me 5000 yen like he promised, although I was so happy about how it went that I tipped him a 1000 yen extra.

TL;DR: went into a taxi, told him to take me wherever he wanted, and got an amazing guided trip through Morioka, as well as plenty of opportunity to try using my terrible Japanese. 10/10, would Omakase in taxi again.",https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/17y4i6q/i_just_went_into_a_taxi_in_morioka_and_told_the/,"This is great, though only advisable in smaller cities where it isn't busy.

1kgzjet,First time in Japan and wow.,"Sorry for the rant.

So earlier today I left my backpack that held my MacBook on the train to the airport hotel and didn‚Äôt notice until many hours later. As in 6 hours later when I was trying to do homework. I looked on the find my app and saw my laptop gps was back in Osaka city while I was by Kansai airport, which is an hour away. It was already 8:30pm and I had to quickly get back on the train to get to where my laptop was. Once I got off the nearest train station, the ticket booth person said the lost and found is closed until 9am tomorrow and the people with the keys are already home. My morning flight was at 10am so I‚Äôm thinking I‚Äôm screwed. I didn‚Äôt want to accept my fate so I asked to speak to his boss. I knocked on a security door, went inside, gave them a description of my backpack, the contents, etc. At this point I thought I would have to miss my flight in the morning because they called around and nothing was turning up. They even called people who were already home. Well Japan has a network of different train/subway lines underground so this boss walked with me asking different workers from different lines, going up and down various stairs and through underground paths. After an hour of this wild goose chase, we finally found it! I tried to tip him cash and he flat out refused. I was so thankful and overwhelmed with relief. Keep in mind this whole time nobody spoke English and I was using Google translate with maybe 10% battery left on my phone. I thanked him profusely but he kept thanking me and bowing too. Our goodbye before we parted ways was like a battle of incessant bowing and saying arigato lol. These Japanese people are so polite, kind, honorable, and willing to help this total foreigner no matter how long it took. This culture is something else. I was blown away that nobody stole my laptop and how willing everyone was to help me with no expectation of a reward. I love Japan! ",https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1kgzjet/first_time_in_japan_and_wow/,Had a similar experience with my wife leaving her bag at a pachinko parlor. We realized she‚Äôd left it about an hour after the fact and it was at the front desk waiting for us. Was pretty shocked that nobody at the barely legal gambling parlor yoinked it lol,"When our flight from Osaka to Tokyo was delayed, an airline employee escorted everyone making a connecting flight through the airport through an employee security line and took us all directly to our gate so we wouldn't miss our flight. 

I have never met such friendly and helpful people before.","I have 2 experiences like this:

1) Wallet fell out of my pocket at the station in Shinjuku at rush hour. THOUSANDS of people. A dude grabbed it and chased me down to give it to me.

2) Wild night out in Osaka. Left my bag on a hook under the bar (customer side). Had passport, wallet, apartment keys, etc. When I figured it out next morning I contacted the bar on IG, they responded almost immediately, opened early, had my bag safe, asked me to open it and make sure it was all there, then when it was - offered me a free shot for the trouble.","My daughter left her bag containing her phone in the bathroom at Tokyo Tower. After realizing she had left it, we went back for it, but it was gone. We went straight to a ticket station, and using Google Translate, this kind worker made a call and escorted us to lost and found. Once we were there, she explained to the person there that it looked exactly like the other bag my other daughter had in her possession. He went back into the room and presented us with my daughter's missing bag. He asked my daughter to unlock the phone; once she did, he gave it back and bowed to us and said thank you (among other things, in Japanese of course) and we did the same. Later on our trip, I left my phone at the register of a flower shop at Tokyo Skytree. The girl at the register who rang me up chased after me when we half way across the shopping area and handed me my phone. I was very grateful to this kind worker. Japanese people are next level. I have two other things that happened during our 14-day trip that really left a great impression on me about the people of Japan, but my post has been long enough.","Had a similar experience where i locked my luggage and laptop in a coin locker in kyoto before my flight back after living in japan for a year. I accidentally threw away the locker receipt which is needed to open it again.. i went back to the familymart that i threw it away at 3 hours earlier (i had 20 minutes until the airport shuttle was departing) and explained to the worker there. The girl went to the back and brought 3 full bags of garbage, sat down and sifted through all kinds of liquid and solid garbage with me to find the receipt, while everyone was waiting to pay at the cash register. Needless to say we didnt find it, but as i ran away she gave me 10 packs of wet tissues to clean myself. Fortunately a worker at the station opened the locker for me and i got to the bus with 5 minutes to spare lol. Never forget"
1gmyxm6,My experience with a UTI in Kyoto,"On the day I arrived to Kyoto, I started developing symptoms for a UTI. I suffer from chronic UTIs and i‚Äôm a nurse so I know how important it is to treat it with antibiotics. My bf and I were researching what to do and where to go to obtain some antibiotics. We stumbled across Kajita Urology, heavily recommended by reddit users but with my luck, of course it was closed that day because it was a public holiday! 

I was in severe pain (10/10) at this point and needed something to manage my pain and symptoms until I was able to see the urologist the next day. We walked to a pharmacy and the pharmacist recommended ‚ÄúJinSenSan.‚Äù This herbal medication drink really helped my symptoms so that I was still able to enjoy my day and not waste our first day in Kyoto. 

On the next day, we called Kajita Urology at 12:30 and asked if we can make an appointment for later on today. Their hours are 9:00-13:00, 16:30-19:30. I was told by the receptionist that they were full for the day and that if I wanted to walk in, I should be prepared to wait for 2 hours.

We arrived to the clinic at 17:00 and was greeted by the receptionist. She notified us again that the wait will be about 2 hours and that I should be prepared to pay up to 10,000 yen (cash only, out of pocket w/ no travel insurance) or more. She asked for my passport, which I just realized that I left in our hotel. Thankfully, the other receptionist said a valid Drivers License would suffice. I agreed to everything and was given paperwork to fill out. I sent my bf to the Lawson across the street to pull out more yen, just in case we didn‚Äôt have enough. 

I sat there and waited for a little bit (roughly 20 mins?) and then the nurse approached me to ask me about my symptoms and to pee in a cup. After peeing, I was instructed to wait again until the doctor was ready to see me. I waited another 20ish minutes and I was called in to see the doctor. 

He notified me that I do in fact have a UTI and that he was going to prescribe me a 5 day course of antibiotics. He also said that the medication drink ‚ÄúJinSenSan‚Äù was a wonderful medication to help manage the symptoms until I was able to get the antibiotics. He handed me the antibiotics and then I was sent on my way. This interaction took only about 5 minutes. He was very nice, spoke perfect English and made sure I had no more questions. 

I went back to the reception table to pay my bill. I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm from America but I was absolutely stunned at the price. My total was 5700 yen, which is only $37!!!!!! My entire doctor visit, urine test PLUS a course of antibiotics only cost me $37 out of pocket!!

Kajita Urology gets a 5 stars from me. The whole process took only an hour. My experience was amazing. The clinic itself was also very nice and clean. I can‚Äôt recommend them enough. They really saved my trip. It is now day 3 on my antibiotics and I feel great!! Hopefully someone in the future finds this post useful :)

TLDR: Developed a UTI at the start of my Japan trip in Kyoto. Found a Urologist (Kajita Urology) recommended by reddit users. Bring passport. Receptionist said 2 hours but was in and out within the hour. Paid 5,700 yen ($37) for the doctor visit, urine test and antibiotics. Doctor spoke perfect English. Clinic was very clean and saved my trip.

1cwwfc0,"I spent 108 days in Japan, and this is what I recommend.","I spent a lengthy amount of time in Japan this past year, 2 months in September and I just got home from another two months March-May. I spent quite a bit of time in lesser-known areas and wanted to share some of my favorite spots if you are looking to experience Japan with fewer tourists.¬†

**Some quick details about me:**

* -I (18F) stayed mainly in hostels, with a $60-70 budget a day. I think I stayed in four or five hotels the entire trip. ¬†
* -I speak an intermediate level of Japanese and can read the majority of menus, signs, etc.. without problem. This really came in handy when reading because when you get FAR in the countryside, there sometimes is no service AND no English translations/no English speakers.¬†
* -I visited 27 prefectures over a collective 108 days in Japan with the two trips.

# Overall favorite prefectures:

* -Hokkaido: so much nature, incredible skiing, not touristy, SO much snow even into April. I bet this would be amazing to escape the July heat!
* -Aomori: there isn‚Äôt much to do in the city of Aomori, but taking a road trip an hour outside gets you to a lot of really amazing places (Takayama Inari Shrine, tsuru no maishashi bridge, Cape Tappi)
* -Fukuoka: I loved this place so much because I visited during full bloom of cherry blossoms. Truly a stunning sight.¬†
* -Fukui: arguably my #1 favourite. I think I noticed one other foreigner during my entire time there, and the attractions there are so unmatched. This prefecture is dinosaur-themed, with huge statues of dinosaurs outside Fukui station, since it has the most dino bones than any other part of Japan.¬†

# Favorite foods:

* -Soup curry, Hokkaido (it will change your life if you‚Äôve never had it)
* -The Full Full Hakata (a bakery in Fukuoka, truly the best in the country imo)
* -Okonomiyaki (of course, I loved the ones in Osaka)

# Unique indoor attractions only in Japan that are totally worth it:

* -Art aquarium in Ginza, Tokyo
* -Nebuta Museum Wa Rasse, Aomori
* -Observation decks were my FAVORITE! Tokyo Skytree, JR T38 in Sapporo, and Fukuoka tower were my top 3.¬†

# Places that you CANNOT MISS if you want to see real Japan (a bit of a long list):

* -Echizen Daibutsu, Fukui: it houses the largest inside statue of Buddha in Japan, and it took my breath away. The temple grounds are beautiful and you can get a bird‚Äôs eye view of Fukui from the pagoda.¬†
* -Lake Toya, Hokkaido: renting a car for this IS WORTH IT! It is a two hour drive from Sapporo. Toya is a volcanic caldera lake and the sights were, literally, some of the best I‚Äôve seen in Japan. There is tons to do around the lake, and my day trip consisted of hiking, waterfalls, ropeway, Hokkaido milk gelato.
* -Mount Aso, Kumamoto: I did this with public transportation from Kumamoto city, but renting a car would save both time and a headache. Aso is an active volcano and while the hike to get up close to the volcano is closed (due to activity), you can get pretty close enough to it. Close enough to breathe in the volcano fumes and uncontrollably cough, along with everyone else there, for the next thirty minutes. Several hiking trails around it are open though, and a few lakes, and it is very pretty. I was there from about 10am-3pm and did three hikes, pet some horses, and got ice cream.¬†
* -Matsushima Bay, Miyagi: Known as one of the top 3 views in all of Japan, it is 260 small islands off the coast of Miyagi. I did the Oku-Matsushima trail, which is a 10km hike that takes you all around the area through bamboo forests, a cemetery, wetlands, unique rock formations, beaches, etc.. at the end it takes you up the mountain to get an incredible view of the bay. Such a cool hike and I literally did not see a single person during my time there.¬†
* -Michinoku coastal trail, Aomori: there is tons of info online, but if you have specific questions feel free to ask. It was a gorgeous hike along the ocean.¬†
* -Sakurajima, Kagoshima: an island right off Kagoshima with an active volcano.¬†
* Toyama: typically an over-looked destination, it has a ton of fun things to do that make a perfect day trip. Glass museum, castle, temples and I was there during a festival.

**Lastly, just a few places I do NOT recommend:**

* -Okayama: just, no. Personally, I found the town to be quite depressing and the locals to not be very nice. Okay for a day trip but there is literally nothing to see in the city other than the castle and the garden. Plus, the castle wasn‚Äôt anything special.¬†
* -Kyoto in the spring. I absolutely loved it in the fall, but the amount of tourists in the spring literally destroyed the experience for me (there was an astonishing amount of disrespectful foreigners). Please consider visiting less popular destinations that still have the same charm as Kyoto during March/April.¬†
* -Tokyo DisneySea: It is significantly smaller than Disneyland but in my opinion not as fun. Sure, it's the only DisneySea in the world, but there really wasn‚Äôt anything crazy special about it. If you‚Äôre a die-hard Disney fan, then 100% sure, but I am a ‚Äúgo once for the experience‚Äù type girl.¬†

I hope this inspires any Japan travelers to get to know the lesser-known destinations :) the golden route is beautiful but I would take these destinations over Osaka and Kyoto any day!

Hokkaido, NOT TOURISTY?

Isn't half the population Australian skiiers? :P

Tokyo Disney Sea is more adult-themed than Land for those who are interested. They sell beer at Disney Sea, not Land for example. The rides are also a bit more for adults (been to land a few times, and nothing really ""scary"" like at Universal Studios etc.)

Cherry blossoms you can see everywhere, Fukuoka is great for the FOOD. Best food in Japan.

Aomori is great for craft breweries and sake.

To add: if you have a car, Shikoku is great for castles, museums, food, temples, and general sightseeing to also keep away from overcrowding.",I hate how good soup curry is. It's one of those things that are niche enough you can't really find it outside the country or even Hokkaido for that matter.,"Okayama - I had a better experience in a short trip there - the city center looked depressing but the locals were quite okay ‚Äî friendlier than those encountered in Tokyo or Nagoya when asking for directions.

I wondered if you ventured out of the city though. Kibitsu shrine was kind of architecturally interesting with the history.

Hinase in Okayama was nice for their kaki-oko (oyster okonomiyaki). Locals there were friendly enough too. 

Did you see ÂÇô‰∏≠ÊùæÂ±±Âüé Matsuyama castle in Takahashi, Okayama? I found the mountain castle in Takahashi very scenic especially when the clouds roll in. The locals there crowned a part ginger cat , Sanjuro as the lord of the castle.

Kurashiki was nice too ‚Äî canal town in Okayama. I‚Äôm returning to Okayama again but to actually explore other places out of the city.",
1kgvxnf,Just returned form a 20 day trip to Japan: my thoughts,"So, I was in Japan for 20 days with my wife visiting Tokyo, Kyoto, Hiroshima, Nara and Osaka, here's what I found out:

* Tokyo is a massive city, I felt that 5 days weren't enough to cover 1% of the place. My wife, being a Peanuts/Snoopy fan made me go to Machida to visit the Peanuts museum (it was great!), we visited Yokohama too (we love theme parks and these kind of attraction) so the COSMO park was very fun too, Tokyo Disney was great, way better than their american counterparts, cleaner, more organized, less crowded. The sheer amount of shrines and temples ws also an attraction of its own, discovering hidden Toriis and temples and shrines in not so touristy neighbourhoods was very fun. On top of all that Tokyo is a super clean metropolis, I had the impression I could lick the asphalt in Shibuya and nothing would stick to my tongue.
* I was surprised by how many old (really old people) were working in the services sector. I don't know if it's a cultural thing or a social security issue, but they were everywhere and they are absolute dolls. so nice, helpful and always with a smile.
* Just like ""Girl from Ipanema"" is an anthem for us Brazilians, the japanese listen to ""Mayonaka no door/Stay with me"" obsessively, everywhere, all the time, in any ocasion.
* I got seriously worried about the mental health status of Dom Quixote workers, that theme song playing nonstop, the noise, the lights and colours, that shop is a crazy ppl factory! üòÇ
* I Osaka, in the last days of my trip I had a medical issue and had to go to clinic fo specialized treatment and it was great, I was initially treated by an older nurse, then by a chinese doctor, that spoke flawless english and both were spot on in the diagnostic and treatment.
* Oh the food, I was never a big fan of japanese food and I found out I never liked japanese food made outside japan. I had a feast there, literally everything I tried was great, tasteful and made with lot of care. from ""cheap food"" like tepanakis and udons to a more elaborate menu, 100% of the food I had there was delicious.
* Public transport is perfect, in all the cities I visited the subway, tram or bus system took me exactly where I wanted to go. It's cheap, and with Google it's super easy to use, I didn't miss a train or hoped on the wrong bus ever.
* A lot of people told me before going that Japan was still a cash based economy. BS. I used my Nomad (charged with dollars) and Revolut (charged with Yens) cards all the time and never had any problems. I used cash only in smaller purchases, like street ice creams stands and to charge my Welcome Suica card, which was quite silly bcs I had to withdraw money and deposit again to chage the card.
* The scale of 7/11 and Lawson operations; man, these businesses run an enormous logistic operation, it's crazy, all the time, everytime the goods in the stores are fresh, paistries are delicious, I was addicted to 7/11 cookies and rice snacks. You can literally do all your meals in these stores and you'll be totally satified.
* Least but not last, the japanese ppl; they're an ""attraction"" of their own. 99% of the time they didn't speak a word in english, but they were so helpful, so interested in helping me and getting things right that the language barrier was not a problem. I know that some ppl in Japan are fed up with tourists, but I didn't notice any of that, I was treated with the utmost respect and attention 100% of the time.

I'm already planning to go back next year, I loved Japan, so much to see and do that oly one trip is not enough!",https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1kgvxnf/just_returned_form_a_20_day_trip_to_japan_my/,We had the same experience! 10/10 would go back!,"As a lifelong Tokyoite, the rare occasions that I hear ""Stay With Me"" are always at really touristy shops haha. I guess the shop owners are catering to what tourists expect to hear.","As far as cash, you can definitely have a trip without having cash on you, but you would miss out on some things depending on what your interests are. Majority of the temples and shrines I went to that had an entry fee were for cash only, same with goushincho payments, and I went in several small art stores & restaurants that were cash only.","I miss it so much too, it‚Äôs such an adventure.

12qlz68,My experience with a medical emergency in Japan today.,"Let me start off by saying Japans healthcare system is a big 10/10. 

My wife had a bad allergic reaction, terrible cramps, vomit, diarrhea, and shaking, from soba today in Kamakura. I walked her to a nearby pharmacy to see if they could help and they sent us to a doctor across the street. He and his assistant checked her out and gave her a steroid shot‚Ä¶ after 15min he told me that he suggest we call an ambulance. I know they‚Äôre free but naturally that moment terrified us. I could tell my wife needed more help so they arrived shortly and were super helpful the whole ride, it was interesting using translation apps the entire ride to talk to them and answer questions. Then we get to the ER and the doctors and nurses were extremely nice and helpful. They gave my wife IV and did bloodwork to confirm the soba (buckwheat) allergy. 

They had a translator who was with us most of the time and even explained how everything was going to work. He basically held our hand each step of the way. The total bill for ALL of this was $230 USD, I couldn‚Äôt believe how cheap it was. 

To the pharmacy workers, the doctor/nurse, the Kamakura amubulance, and to the doctors/nurse/translator at shonan Kamakura general hospital, and Japans overall health care system I can‚Äôt thank you enough!! 
They turned our terrifying afternoon into a night of laughing about the whole situation. I wish the US had 1/4 the quality I experience here in Japan.

My lesson to anyone reading this would be to not hesitate to call an ambulance in Japan.",https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/12qlz68/my_experience_with_a_medical_emergency_in_japan/,"> I know they‚Äôre free but naturally that moment terrified us.

As someone living in the EU I still, to this day, can not comprehend this mentality. How expensive must it be to call an ambulance to be terrified by something that's supposed to save you... So unreal.

Sorry this situation happened to you OP and happy your wife's doing OK ! Take care","How unfortunate to discover a buckwheat allergy in Japan, this is my worst nightmare!","Had a near identical allergy situation with my wife in Tokyo. I got travel insurance so I wasn‚Äôt too worried but just a little concerned I‚Äôd go over my credit limit once we got to $10,000+ from an ambulance ride & ER.

It really does put our system to shame in the US.","Should rename the title to, ‚Äúmy experience of healthcare not in the USA‚Äù.   This is normal for a lot of us. Glad you got to experience it.",
1crc339,I think I (a foreigner) just got groped on the subway,"*I tried to post this in r/japan but automod took it down and the mods haven‚Äôt gotten back to me yet. So, this is probably the more appropriate subreddit. For clarification, this happened yesterday night.*

I (26F) am traveling with my family in Japan. We were on a very crowded subway train cart on the ‰∏∏„ÉéÂÜÖÁ∑ö (Marunouchi Line) in Tokyo around 21:30. This is my third time in Japan and l've taken the subway and public transport many times, but this was a first.

I'm still sort of processing it, but I didn't quite realize what happened until I got off the subway cart. I just don't know if this is common, and l've never been groped before so l didn't realize what was happening until my brain was like wait, that was someone's hand/fingers groping the back of my thigh/butt on the subway car....

Just, uh, yeahh. Maybe it's just Tokyo? It's my first time in this city and I have always been in the Kansai region during my previous visits. Never ever have I had issues there.

I still feel it (and a little disgusted/shocked) and I want to know if anyone else has experienced something like this as some form of ""I'm not crazy to have experienced this in 2024.""

EDIT: **Of course being Â§ñ‰∫∫ doesn‚Äôt make any difference,** I just didn‚Äôt know what to do once I fully processed what had happened. 

EDIT 2:

Thank you all for your validating responses and those of you who also shared your experiences. I wanted to add a little more information for those who may want to use this post for reference.

First, yes, I know there are women-only cars, and I have used them in the past. They are great and I recommend them for gals to use if they would like a safe space. However, their times can be limited (for instance on the particular line I took, it said designated train cars were women-only before 9:30 during rush hour, and didn‚Äôt see any indication it was women-only in the late evening). Furthermore, I‚Äôm also traveling with my dad and brother. I‚Äôd prefer to stick with them so we don‚Äôt get separated, especially during more busy times since men aren‚Äôt allowed in the cars during women-only times. (Though young children, 12 and under are acceptable in women-only cars.)

Second, I truly appreciate those who gave advice. From what I gathered, yelling: 

‚Äúchikan‚Äù Áó¥Êº¢ (groper)
‚Äúhentai‚Äù Â§âÊÖã (pervert)
or ‚Äúyamero‚Äù „ÇÑ„ÇÅ„Çã (stop)

while also clearly indicating who it is (if possible), maybe grabbing their hand and raising it, and making a fuss can get the behavior to stop immediately and provide intervention. Although, it can be hard to identity someone in a packed car (for instance I was groped from behind and I was carrying my backpack in front of me because of the limited space on the train) so I probably should have grabbed their hand first to help identify who it was and then yelled and make a loud fuss. Further, grabbing the culprit/assaulter and taking them to the police at the next stop will ensure they get in trouble for their behavior. They may go willingly after you‚Äôve publicly shamed them and made a fuss. However, try to not physically assault or instigate a physical fight with the assaulter as it could result you landing in jail. I could argue depending on the circumstance they may ‚Äúdeserve it,‚Äù but it is probably best to not escalate the situation in a harmful way.

6379ap,Wasting my time in Japan,"I've just spent my first 7 days in Tokyo but have done almost nothing. With another 3 weeks to go I'd like to change that. 

I've visited all the major locations like Akihabara, Ueno, Ikebukuro, Asakusa, Meguro, Shibuya, Harajuku and Shinjuku. However all I do is get there and walk around. Most of the time I don't even enter any shops because I don't need to buy anything. 

The only things I've *done* are AirBnB experiences (which were great) and @home maid caf√©. However AirBnB doesn't offer experiences in Japan outside Tokyo and I plan to travel to Kansai now.

aiplfn,Japanese hospitality in my time of need,"I posted this as a comment on another subreddit, but thought it was worth sharing here.

My phone was stolen when I was visiting Japan last spring. I speak a little Japanese, but I was seriously relying on my phone for translation, as well as directions and booking hotels.

As I was walking around the train station hoping to find it and crying, a businessman saw me and with very limited English asked me to wait as he called one of his employees who was fluent in English to help. They were incredible. The lady helped me ask the ÈßÖÈï∑ and others if my phone had been turned in, directed me to the lost and found at another station, and, once I emailed her from my laptop to let her know I hadn‚Äôt had any luck, she and her boss took me out for lunch and had me stay at their office (a fashion company!) for the rest of the day while I figured out hotels and transportation with my laptop. Two other employees treated me to (the best I‚Äôve ever had) ramen and showed me around Osaka that evening, as well as getting me to the hotel I had booked. The boss even lent me his pocket translator for the rest of my trip.

I can‚Äôt imagine encountering that much kindness and hospitality anywhere but Japan, but even there it was absolutely incredible. I got their address and sent them thank you gifts once I got back home, but there‚Äôs no way I could repay them for all the ways they helped me and absolutely saved the rest of my trip from disaster.",https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/aiplfn/japanese_hospitality_in_my_time_of_need/,"That's so kind! I hope that if I see someone in a similar situation in my home country I could help them. I love this story. I'm glad everything worked out for you.


PS - On a side note, how did that pocket translator work? I have been considering buying one.","I love this, and it doesn‚Äôt surprise me at all for Japan. During my first visit, I left my phone charger in my hotel room at With the Style in Fukuoka. When I arrived at my hotel in Kyoto the next day, it was waiting for me with the concierge, along with a handwritten note from the general manager at With the Style saying how much he enjoyed chatting with me during my stay. I don‚Äôt remember ever mentioning the exact name of my hotel in Kyoto to him, only that it was in Gion near  Shijo Dori station. He must‚Äôve called all the hotels nearby to figure out which one I was headed for - I just can‚Äôt think of any other explanation. And all that for a phone charger I could‚Äôve easily replaced! Japan and its people are something else, and we could all learn from their example in hospitality.  ","We had similar experiences, but the one which really stood out for me was the staff at the hostel where we were staying translated and wrote a note for me to take to the grocery store asking for a specific item !

 My daughter, who was maybe 8 at the time, is anaphylactic and all she wanted was cup noodles as a snack, thinking that the colours would correspond with those at home, I grabbed the green one thinking it would be chicken- but it was prawn- one of her allergens!

 Feeling defeated I asked the staff to help- they wrote a list of things I needed for my daughter and told me to take it to the supermarket and hand it to staff. The staff actually went and picked all my items and were so lovely, it made my daughter so happy just to have noodles, something so simple, but for a kid it meant everything! ","I'm sure this would happen elsewhere in Japan cos I've heard lots of similar stories of people going beyond out of their way to help people in need but I find the friendliest people/area has always been Osaka. People just seem a bit more at ease there. It's my go to city when visiting Japan. Tokyo, Kyoto etc are all cool but Osaka is accessible and manageable to visit. I've yet to not have an amazing time there. I find it odd that so many people on this sub tell people to stay away from Osaka. I feel like they're missing the point of the city and only look at the exterior of it (which I still think is super nice in its own way).

Last year after the Typhoon that knocked out the airport and the bridge my flight ended up flying into Nagoya instead of Osaka about a week after and I traveled by train to Osaka. There were no tourists in the city. I swear I saw like two or three other people over the span of a few days in Namba. Everywhere I went people kept apologizing for the typhoon and thanking me for visiting. It was crazy and goes to show the level of care people in Japan give to tourists.  ","Maybe this is just my own personal experiences, but people in Osaka always go above and beyond. I caught the flu on my third day there back in November, accidentally locked my key in my hotel room (didnt realize this until I got back), and had had no idea what japanese flu meds looked like. Got directed to a pharmacy by the hotel staff, the pharmacy staff took one look at me and immediately hooked me up with some phenomenal meds that had be back to 100% inside of 24 hours, and the hotel staff had been kind enough to leave a bag on the door of my room wish fresh towels and extra tea while I was away. The hotel manager was super cool when I told him I'd locked my key in my room too, I feel super bad for him since later that night there were some particularly rowdy guests in the lobby. 

Osaka is absolutely a 'must hit' every time I go back to japan now, and that particular hotel will absolutely be my first choice, both for it's location and its outstanding service. "

>**""The Cabinet on Tuesday approved a bill that would enable Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to declare a state of emergency, if needed, as Japan scrambles to stop the spread of the new coronavirus. Abe, who faced criticism for being too relaxed in his initial response to the outbreak, has sought the power to prepare for a ‚Äúworst case scenario.‚Äù**

>**""Moreover, the prime minister has extended a government request to event organizers nationwide to refrain from holding such gatherings by about 10 days. The request was initially until March 19.""**

>**""The legal change would allow the prime minister to declare a state of emergency lasting up to two years if coronavirus infections spread rapidly across the country and fears are raised of a grave impact on people‚Äôs lives and the economy.""**

>**""Once an emergency is declared, prefectural governors can instruct residents to stay indoors and ask for schools to close and events to be canceled.""**

>**""Local governments can also demand that essential supplies such as medicine and food be sold to them. They can temporarily take over private land and facilities to provide medical care.""**

>**""Abe has already requested that schools across the nation close and big sports and cultural events be canceled or postponed. But under the current law, the government does not have the legal power to enforce school closures or event cancellations.""**

>**""The main opposition Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan and the Democratic Party for the People say the prime minister should seek prior parliamentary approval before any declaration of a state of emergency.""**

**Once again, *this bill does not enact a State of Emergency for the country*, it merely means to reflect and strengthen the laws put in place from previous viral outbreaks in Japan.**

>‚ÄúWe will strengthen immigration quarantines on people from the two countries,‚Äù Abe told a Cabinet-level task force meeting on the virus.

>‚ÄúWe will ask them to stay in designated areas for two weeks and not to use public transport in the country.‚Äù

>""The measure will take effect at 12:00 a.m. on March 9 and last through March 31, he said.""

>""The government is calling for tourists from China, where the virus emerged and South Korea, which has been hard hit by the outbreak, to put off travel to Japan and will cancel visas for travelers from the two countries, Abe said.""

>**‚ÄúIn order to reduce the amount of in-bound travel from China and South Korea, we will limit arrival destinations for aircraft from the two countries to Narita and Kansai airports,‚Äù he said.**

>**The visa suspensions will effectively ban all Chinese nationals from entering Japan.**

>**‚ÄúWe will suspend transport of passengers by ship and cancel temporary and multiple-entry visas that have already been issued,‚Äù Abe said.**

>**Flights from China and South Korea will be able to land only in Narita Airport near Tokyo and Osaka‚Äôs Kansai Airport, he said. Abe also said that bans on entering Japan will be expanded to foreign nationals who have been in any part of South Korea or Iran.**

>**This appears to be seperate from a bigger bill aimed at reducing the number of overall tourists at this moment to halt the spread of the virus.** [**The NHK has posted an article on the other measures of the bill,**](https://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/en/news/20200305_50/) **and how it will allow the Government to enact a State Of Emergency - giving them the power to ""control some businesses' operating hours, close schools and instruct people to stay indoors. Authorities would also be able to use buildings and land without their owners' consent for medical purposes.""**  

**In short, if you are a Korean or Chinese National, you will not be allowed to enter the country without facing a 14 day quarantine. Any planes arriving from either location will only be processed at either Narita or Kansai Airport, starting March 9th, and lasting until March 31st. It will also include visitors from Hong Kong and Macau, as well as Japanese Nationals coming from these countries - we are assuming this includes those returning from vacation in those areas. Entry Visas are being cancelled, for China, Korea, Hong Kong, Macau, and Iran which sounds like it means you will be quarantined at the border, and could be sent home after the 14 days are up.**

**If you have a flight with a stopover in either country, you would be wise to contact your airline right away and arrange to either fly direct, or re-route through a different area to avoid getting caught up in the quarantine. We have no confirmation that stopovers are excluded OR included in this requirement, but it's better to be safe than sorry.**


##**TOURISM UPDATE 02/29**
>[**More temporary closures and cancellations have been added to the list, please click here to go directly to the comment. We are updating this list as information comes in, and have split the lists by area.**](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/evs3f9/japan_travel_the_2019ncov_and_you_guidelines_on/fih7ih7/) 

##**TOURISM UPDATE 02/28**  

>[**The Japanese Government has rolled out requirements to help curb the spread of the virus, as the next two weeks are crucial for transmission within the country.**](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2020/02/25/national/science-health/japan-guidelines-covid19-coronavirus/#.XlaKGChKiUk) Presumably, this is why we are currently seeing an increase in closures and cancellations by locations that would normally draw crowds of tourists and locals, such as museums and sports events. 

>The Government is asking people to take even more care when in public with frequent handwashing and sanitizing, and wearing a mask if you plan to be out in large crowds for long periods of time. **As tourists, you should consistently perform with the utmost caution to follow these rules to help prevent yourself from catching the virus.** [The NHK has provided a very helpful article](https://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/en/news/backstories/877/) (with video!) that explains how to wash your hands properly and thoroughly to help break down the chain of bacteria and viruses, and how to wear a mask properly to help stop the spread of infection.  

**We'd like to remind you that while these measures are effective when applied consistently, they will not necessarily prevent you from catching the virus in the aforementioned ""large crowds"" that the Health Ministry is asking people to avoid.** This information is intended as a guideline to help prevent transmission, but certain risk groups should see this as a warning that the Government is expecting things to get worse before they get better, and they should closely look at the options for travel, as **the best method for not catching COVID-19 in Japan is to not go at this time.**   

##**TOURISM UPDATE 02/23** 

**[The CDC has raised the alert level for travel to Japan to Level 2.](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices/alert/coronavirus-japan) This means they are advising that tourists practice enhanced measures to protect themselves from the spread of the virus. Please check the link above for more information. If you are older or have pre-existing health conditions, the CDC now also firmly recommends reconsidering travel to Japan.**

>**If a potential quarantine on arrival home after your trip would disrupt your life enough to cause hardship (job loss, arranging last minute care for family/pets, possible transmission to vulnerable individuals) we firmly recommend that you postpone travel at this time.**

##**TOURISM UPDATE 02/21**

**Transmission and hospitalization in children under the age of 10 has been confirmed in Sapporo, with 3 recent cases being revealed.** The Japan Times has more information [here.](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2020/02/21/national/hokkaido-coronavirus/#.XlAjvFNlAwA) One child is a preschooler who returned from Wuhan with his parents on a chartered evacuation flight in January, and the child is recovering from a mild infection. The other two cases are local to Hokkaido, one is under the age of 10, the other is presumed to be a bit older, but reported to be elementary school aged. Both have been hospitalized and are recovering.  
**We would urge you to confirm with your pediatrician or family physician before travel with children to Japan in the face of this news. It has been reported that children are not often afflicted, or may have mild symptoms, but that does not equate immunity to the virus - as shown here.** 

##**TOURISM UPDATE 02/04:**

**The JNTO (Japan National Tourism Organization) is advising any and all tourists arriving in Japan to have travel health insurance in case they require treatment or hospitalization as a result of contracting the virus. The Government of Japan *will NOT cover the costs* associated with treatment during this time, and you *will* be required to pay out of pocket should an infection occur, and you have no insurance.**  

[**More information can be found at the following link from the JNTO, along with links to companies that will provide travel health insurance IN Japan on arrival.**](https://www.japan.travel/en/news/coronavirus/)  

**We strongly recommend you add Trip Cancellation *and* Travel Health Insurance to your budget before you depart - for precisely this kind of occurrence. Please take the time to research travel insurance, and confirm with your bank or personal health care plan what is covered, or not covered, and purchase a plan that meets your needs in accordance with your trip.** 

##**TOURISM UPDATE 01/31:**

**The NHK has published an article reporting that JNTO has a phone number to call should tourists *currently in Japan* require assistance. We would not recommend contacting this number if you are not currently in the country, as this line is intended to assist with possible cases and have them directed to medical facilities for treatment.** [The article has been removed, but we have a link to the phone numbers here.](https://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/en/news/20200131_41/amp.html) There is also a link to the JNTO for further information, if needed.

>**""The Japan National Tourism Organization is offering phone consultation services for foreign tourists who are concerned about the new strain of coronavirus.""**

>""The Japan Visitor Hotline offers 24-hour services in Japanese, English, Chinese and Korean.""

>**""The hotline can refer callers who may be infected with the virus to the nearest medical institution.** It also provides information on measures to prevent infection such as hand washing and gargling.""

>""The organization encourages foreign tourists to call if they have any concerns.""

>**""The hotline number is 050-3816-2787.**""

##General Information  

##**""What is COVID-19? How does it affect me?""**  

 
[**The FAQ from the CDC on COVID-19 is here.**](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/faq.html)  
 
[**The symptoms more frequently noted include the following:**](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/symptoms.html)  

>- **High fever.**  

>- **Shortness of Breath.** This is an absolute call to health authorities, if you or anyone in your travel group experiences this symptom you should be notifying staff of your hotel/hostel right away for medical assistance.  

>- **Coughing, with or without phlegm.** If you begin to cough, and feel very congested in the chest quickly, do not delay in notifying health authorities. Pneumonia is one of the reasons why this flu is deadly in certain people, and the CDC has already recorded an instance in China where a healthy 36 year old victim died from pneumonia brought on by the virus. **There is currently no treatment for this virus, aside from supportive care to relieve symptoms. Any cases diagnosed with pneumonia are generally hospitalized.**  

[The recommendations for curbing the spread of COVID-19 is detailed on this page.]( https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/prevention-treatment.html)   

**Major risks with this virus are:**

>- **Transmission from person to person has been noted in Japan.**  

>- **It can take up to 14 days before you show ANY symptoms**, meaning that your body is shedding the virus in bodily fluids such as exhalation (commonly called aerosol), mucus from the nose and mouth, and fecal matter.  

>- **Carriers of the virus can be asymptomatic** (not showing any symptoms like sneezing/coughing) while they are transmitting the virus to others.  

**The crux of curbing any virus is to wash your hands, or use sanitizer on a frequent basis when touching items in public. Also:**   

>-  **Do not touch your eyes, nose, or mouth with hands that have not been washed or sanitized.**  

>-  **Cover any coughs or sneezes with your arm, and/or a tissue. Throw the tissue away, and wash your hands afterwards.**  

>-  **If you are opening doors and wish to avoid picking up anything from door handles, use your elbow or foot to push the door open if possible.**   
 
##**‚ÄúI‚Äôm traveling to Japan in March/April/May. Should I cancel my trip and reschedule?‚Äù**  
 
**If you are travelling from China, Korea, Hong Kong, Macau, or Iran, please pay special attention to the update from 03/06. Japan is currently moving to block tourists from those regions to control the spread of the virus within the country. You will be quarantined and possibly sent home after the 14 days is up, as travel visas for those countries are being cancelled as of 03/09. Please contact your airline for more information. In the CDC Level 2 Warning above, they have specifically advised that individuals with pre-existing health problems look to cancel any non-essential travel to Japan at this time. We have noted other instances in the** [**FAQ**](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/wiki/faqs/japantravel#wiki_.22i_need_some_information_about_the_covid-19_situation_in_japan._what_do_you_know_at_this_time.3F.22) and provided further information. Some examples include:**  

>- **If you have a compromised immune system, have asthma, are prone to serious lung infections, are long-term heavy smokers, or reside full-time with anyone in your home that has any of those health concerns.**

>- **If you are traveling with anyone under the age of 5, or over the age of 50-60, and/or they would be considered in a risk group for the seasonal flu.**  

>- **If you do not have a Trip Cancellation, or Travel Health Insurance package prior to departure, you should strongly reconsider not purchasing it prior to leaving your home country. On February 4th, the JNTO confirmed that tourists without travel health insurance would not be covered by the Japanese Government for treatment if infection occurred, and the patient will have to pay out of pocket for any treatment required. Please see the FAQ for information on obtaining insurance on arrival in Japan from either Tokio Marine, or Sompo Japan Nipponkoa. Note that you will only be able to access either website linked through JNTO on arrival in Japan.**

>- **If you are in any way concerned about contracting an illness that would put you out of commission for your entire trip, and may require hospitalization. Some users have already informed us that they are being told they would be subject to a mandatory 14 day self-quarantine at home on return from their trip. If you would not able to comply with those restrictions on arrival from Japan, (work, family, pet responsibilities for instance) you will want to seriously reconsider your trip.**

##**‚ÄùI‚Äôm traveling for the Olympics! Is this going to affect the Games? What do I do?‚Äù**  

>**At this time, there is no clear indication that the Olympics will be affected.** The IOC's spokesperson did an interview with the Associated Press on the possibility that the games could be postponed or moved to a different city, and it was noted it was far more likely they would be cancelled outright. [**(IOC Member Casts Doubt on Postponing Or Moving Tokyo Games - Associated Press.)**](https://apnews.com/58043910be7bdc6818344bdee2096bc2) **This is not a solid YES or NO at this time. We will update when necessary if the situation changes.**

##**‚ÄùI‚Äôm currently in Japan, and have been feeling unwell, as outlined in the CDC links above. What do I do?‚Äù**  

>**Please contact the phone number posted above for assistance. The number is a direct line to the JNTO, who is working in partnership with public health agencies in Japan, and they will assess you and direct you to proper medical facilities for treatment.** Please do not attempt to shelter in place without notifying the proper health authorities, as you could still be transmitting the virus to others, including other tourists, staff, and the general public.

##**We'd like to thank everyone at this time for all their assistance on this matter! Helping us to keep up to date with the closures and flight information has been a massive help while this situation is rapidly changing.**",https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/evs3f9/japan_travel_the_2019ncov_and_you_guidelines_on/,"Currently day 3 of being in Japan. My best advice for people who are still wanting to go, especially in the next few days or weeks, stay off of reddit lol. Go on websites like the CDC and figure out if you should still go or not. 

There‚Äôs a lot of people talking about how they won‚Äôt get to enjoy Japan because they have to constantly wash their hands or use hand sanitizer and worry about touching their faces, like do you guys normally not do that during cold and flu season in your country? 

I see people of all variety in Tokyo, I saw a guy with a mask and latex gloves on. I saw a group of college kids on the train touching the holds without masks on. People are still friendly (I read someone say Japanese people are unfriendly to tourists because they‚Äôre scared or some other weird reason). I went to Senso-ji, shimokitizawa, and Shibuya yesterday and there‚Äôs still a lot of people walking around, not panicking, still friendly, still enjoying their lives. 

In the end make the decision yourself, don‚Äôt let people on reddit influence or scare you into coming or not. If you feel safe about coming then do so, if you feel like you won‚Äôt be able to enjoy Japan or afraid of a quarantine or getting sick, rebook or cancel. 

If anyone has any questions while I‚Äôm in Japan go ahead and ask, I‚Äôll try and remain as unbiased as possible.

Edit: I forgot to mention I will be here until March 7th. Feel free to DM or reply to me if anyone has any questions.",[deleted],"##**CLOSURE ALERTS 03/10**

1kmgm4m,I've traveled through 25 prefectures and many different towns within them. Here are my incredibly specific recommendations of things you probably won't easily hear about when researching Japan travel,"I live in Japan and one of my favorite things to do is travel here. I tried to narrow this list down to things that you may not easily find otherwise, though note that any of these areas have some other more popular attractions nearby, which I included for the purpose of helping you make a potential itinerary. All of these have been absolute highlights during my years of travelling through Japan, and I encourage you to check them out :)

* **The Last Classroom**¬†\-¬†*Tokamachi, Niigata Prefecture*
   * Haunting, immersive, truly¬†**one-of-a-kind art museum/installation**¬†buried in a rural Niigata onsen town. It's an¬†**abandoned school**¬†that was¬†**turned into an art exhibit**¬†about isolation and emptiness. It's only open on the weekend, but going through it alone (very few people I think know about this/go to it) was unforgettable. Pictures don't do justice to the experience of walking through this ghostly space. Let yourself become immersed in its world and it is incredibly emotionally affective.
   * **Nearby**: Bijinbayashi Forest, Kiyotsu Light Gorge, many onsen/ryokan
* **Amanoiwato Shrine**¬†\-¬†*Takachiho, Miyazaki Prefecture*
   * One of Japan's¬†**most significant shrines within its religious canon**, being the location of perhaps the most famous story of the sun goddess Amaterasu. This is like if we knew the location of where Jesus arose from his grave and could visit it. Walking through the gorge to this shrine is an experience of its own, and the shrine is a unique beauty nestled within a cliff enclave, surrounded by piles of stones carefully placed by visitors.
   * **Nearby**: Takachiho Gorge (recommend river boating through it)
* **Togakushi Shrine**¬†\-¬†*Nagano, Nagano Prefecture*
   * A¬†**shrine nestled up in the mountain forests**¬†outside Nagano city. The temple grounds are expansive and to be honest, I got lost when I explored there. But in doing so I found a hidden cafe run by a grandpa so that's a bonus. The shrine itself is wonderfully secluded, under the cover of forest leaves, and has been one of my favorite shrines of the hundred or so I've visited.
   * **Nearby**: Nagano City
* **≈ånami Lake**¬†\-¬†*Kirishima, Kagoshima Prefecture*
   * A¬†**lake at the summit of a mountain**¬†in a volcanic range,¬†**formed from a crater**. This makes it an uncannily circular lake with incredibly clear water that comes from the volcanic groundwater. The¬†**hiking trail**¬†around the lake is pretty unintimidating with gorgeous views all around, but I will warn that getting UP to the hiking trail is a good 40 minute trek uphill. Once you're there though, you have incredible scenery for miles.
   * **Nearby**: Kirishima Jingu, Kirishima Kinkowan National Park (this lake is technically part of the park)
* **Miyakowasure**¬†\-¬†*Semboku, Akita Prefecture*
   * A¬†**secluded ryokan in the countryside**¬†of Akita. The name of the onsen literally translates to ""forget the city,"" and BOY will you. This is the most secluded, isolated, private ryokan I have ever been to. Each room comes with a¬†**private onsen**¬†with a beautiful view of the nearby forest or river. The service is also the highest quality I have ever received in all my time in Japan. It's pricey, but given the sheer quality, I think it's undoubtedly worth it for a night or two of luxury (and FANTASTIC food).
   * **Nearby**: Kakunodate (the ""little Kyoto"" of northern Japan), Lake Tawazu
* **Takkoku-no-Iwaya Bishamond≈ç**¬†\-¬†*Ichinoseki, Iwate Prefecture*
   * Over¬†**1000-year-old Buddhist temple built into a cliffside**¬†as part of its structure. It's still in active use and you may be able to see some prayer or ceremonies by the shrine priests. The main temple is very interesting and the temple grounds have a lot to see within a small space, especially the garden. Lovely integration with nature.
   * **Nearby**: Geibikei Gorge and Genbikei Gorge (yes they're different, I highly recommend river boating through Geibikei Gorge)
* **Himeji Yukata Festival**¬†\-¬†*Himeji, Hyogo Prefecture*
   * Late June festival that's¬†**one of the best festivals**, I think, to¬†**experience Japanese festival culture**¬†between food stalls, games, and (of course) yukata. Many streets are overtaken by stalls and hundreds of guests in traditional Japanese clothing, with the view of Himeji Castle illuminated in the background.
   * **Nearby**: Himeji Castle (my personal favorite castle in Japan btw)
* **Yakushima Hiking**¬†\-¬†*Yakushima, Kagoshima Prefecture*
   * Island off the southern coast of Kagoshima covered in¬†**thick forests**¬†protected as a¬†**UNESCO World Heritage Site**. This island is the aesthetic inspiration for Princess Mononoke and has many hiking trails from beginner to advanced (though I would recommend only able-bodied individuals attempt, since even the easy trails can have some unsteady terrain). The¬†**best hiking experience**¬†I've had in Japan.
   * **Nearby**: Stay on the island overnight. Enjoy a hotel and the beach.
* **Biking through Kibi Plain**¬†\-¬†*Okayama, Okayama Prefecture*
   * Want to comfortably¬†**experience the Japanese countryside**¬†without being lost in fields with nothing to do and no hotels nearby? Kibi Plain is easily accessible from major hub Okayama City and has a very well-marked biking route through the prefecture's major temples and beautiful plains of farms and rice paddies.
   * **Nearby**: Okayama City (particularly recommend Korakuen Garden)
* **Yamadera Temple**¬†\-¬†*Yamadera, Yamagata Prefecture*
   * One of the absolute¬†**best temples in Japan**. Mountain scenery, forests, gardens, trails through nature, cliffside views, everything you could want from a nature experience. The way the shrine is built into the structure of the mountain range is beautiful and a treat to wander through. Stunning all year round though the fall foliage is particularly recommended.
   * **Nearby**: Yamagata City
* **Tonami Tulip Fair**¬†\-¬†*Tonami, Toyama Prefecture*
   * Through the month of April to early May,¬†**tulips bloom**¬†throughout Toyama prefecture, best displayed at the Tulip Festival.¬†**Hundreds of breeds of tulip**¬†like you've never seen in gorgeous¬†**Dutch-inspired displays.**¬†Held for multiple weeks but you can catch performances on weekends. Colorful and magical.
   * **Nearby**: At around the same time of year, Johana Hikiyama Matsuri in Johana town, which is a UNESCO intangible cultural heritage.
* **Lake Juniko**¬†\-¬†*Fukaura, Aomori Prefecture*
   * Collection of¬†**twelve lakes**¬†scattered all in close proximity through the forests of Shirakami Sanchi. These lakes are known for their¬†**almost unnaturally blue water**. They are mystifying to look at given just how clear the water is. The most famous, Aoike, is the best for viewing this phenomenon.

You could spend a night or two in Maebashi, 50 mins from Tokyo. While it‚Äôs currently on the brink of revitalization, the city isn‚Äôt as established as a Tokyo or Osaka. However, consider staying at the Shiroiya Hotel, an art and architecture destination. The hotel is self sustainable, with its own bakery, coffee shop, patisserie, speakeasy, fine dining, and casual dining- all of which offer exceptional food! Their service is really top notch too. I highly recommend dining at The Restaurant inside the hotel. It‚Äôs a concept created by a head chef from Gunma prefecture and the head chef from Floril√®ge. It was one of the best meals we had in Tokyo, especially considering the price. You can meals onto your hotel stay which also includes a huge Japanese breakfast at The Lounge.

Initially, I planned for three nights there, followed by two nights at a ryokan up north. I recommend staying 1 or 2 nights max. Be sure to check in on a Friday or Saturday night when all their businesses at the hotel are all open, as some may be closed at the beginning of the week.

From there, you can go to Arts Maebashi, Maebashi Galleria, Rose Avenue for lunch, and Donryu-Yokocho Alley for casual drinks. Take a day trip to the Hara Museum, go hiking or canoeing up north, or visit an onsen like Sekizenkan. If you want to try a head spa in Japan, I went to HeadspaBeautyÈ´™Â±ã from the owner Mari which was recommended by ASMR Twix approximately 8 minutes on foot from the hotel.",This is the kind of information I‚Äôve been hoping to find on this sub.

1mcwa25,Tsunami Warning,"We experienced our first tsunami warning this morning in Kamakura. At about 9:30 this morning our cell phones had loud messages and the public PA system were broadcasting warnings to get to higher ground. 

We were going to go up a hill behind our Airbnb but there was a senior citizen centre that invited us up to their roof.  The staff were looking after the senior citizens but they still took the time to check on us and to offer us water.

A few things that we learned or reinforced old lessons:

- It‚Äôs always good to have a stock of water bottles ready to go. We had picked some up the night before to use for breakfast and we were able to quickly grab them and head out the door 

- Hats and umbrellas help. We were on a roof for several hours before we were told that we could leave and there wasn‚Äôt much shade. Grab hats and umbrellas when heading out the door. 

- Having food available would be good, especially if the situation is very bad. There was no warnings before the alarms started going off so we took what we could. 

- I also grabbed our wallets and passports on the way out as we didn‚Äôt know when we would be back. Also it‚Äôs always good to have them with you at all times. 

- I didn‚Äôt even think to look for signs for the tsunami evacuation centres before hand. There was someone directing everyone on the street but in retrospect I wish that I had taken a look at the map of evacuation centres before hand. 

This is our sixth trip to Japan and the first time we experienced this. Luckily it wasn‚Äôt bad where we were, hopefully the rest of the country is OK. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1mcwa25/tsunami_warning/,"Update:

This has been officially downgraded to a Tsunami advisory.

Waves of 20cm were observed in Tokyo bay.  Waves of 60cm were observed in Eastern Hokkaido and Iwate.

While it is now only an advisory, it is recommended to still be alert if you are near the coast for warnings/signs of change.

If you are travelling in Japan, it is recommended to get the NERV app for your phone: [https://nerv.app/en/](https://nerv.app/en/)","Just to be clear : the warning is for waves up to 3m.

""1m"" may seem small, but it will knock wash away an adult very easily. Even 10cm can knock you. 

This is a [20cm tsunami](https://youtu.be/hefuYPL4Uoc?t=21), this [is 40cm](https://youtu.be/hefuYPL4Uoc?t=78), this [is 50cm](https://youtu.be/8gNwKUAL9l4?t=241)

And the [first few seconds ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gNwKUAL9l4)of this vid show a 50cm or so of a (real) tsunami.

This is not a wave like at the beach, it's the sea suddenly rising and flowing inwards.

  
TLDR : take the warnings seriously.",I'm glad folks took care of you and that you're safe!,"This is the one for discussion.  All others will be removed.

Just a FYI, this is still developing.  Kamakura is not out of the woods yet.","To be clear, it is legally required that you have your passport with you at all times. It‚Äôs more than just a good recommendation."
1buloqk,Tsunami Warning Experience,"My wife and I are currently staying at the Hoshinoya resort on Taketomi in the Yaeyama Islands, and I wanted to share our experience going through the tsunami warnings causes by the earthquake in Taiwan this morning. 

We were on a shuttle bus to go snorkeling when the initial warnings came through. Both my wife and I got emergency alerts on our phones - she is using a pocket wifi and I'm on a data-only eSIM. Glad to report that the emergency notification system here works regardless of how you're connected. We didn't feel the earthquake from inside the bus, but other guests told us that they felt very mild tremors. 

After a short period of information gathering, our bus driver promptly brought us back to the resort. We were initially told that the area was safe and that we could return to our room. However, we soon started seeing additional alerts on our phones and decided to find higher ground on the resort property. Hotel staff must have gotten additional information at that time, and they began sweeping the property and gathering all guests at the front desk. We boarded shuttle buses and were taken to the local elementary school, which is the town's official tsunami evacuation point. 

We stayed there for about 2 hours until given the all clear. There were probably a few hundred people at the school, both tourists and locals. We were comfortable enough, and the local officials distributed water multiple times. They gave relatively frequent updates in Japanese and checked in individually with each person to ensure everyone was doing okay. The hotel staff provided key updates in English, and we always felt sufficiently safe and in the loop. 

Overall, we were incredibly impressed by the efficiency, professionalism, and kindness of the hotel staff and local officials. Moreover, the calm demeanor and stoicism of the locals and tourists alike were on full display throughout the entire ordeal.  As a bonus, the resort offered free use of our mini bars and complementary lunch when we returned. üôÇ 

No one wants to go through something like this while traveling in a remote place where you don't speak the language, but I can't imagine a much better place to be than Japan when it does. I feel very grateful and privileged to be here - I hope today's news doesn't dissuade anyone from coming here in the future.

To anyone out there affected by the earthquake or the aftermath, I hope you're safe and that your travels get back on track!",https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1buloqk/tsunami_warning_experience/,"Taipei here. It‚Äôs been 8 hours and the after shocks has not stop at all. It comes every 10 mins probably mg 1<0. Pretty annoying. After shocks are normal after a big one, but this duration is unusual and I‚Äôve been in bigger ones, but never this long in aftershocks. As I type there‚Äôs another aftershock.",You had an unique experience. You could see how well prepared and efficient the Japanese authorities are. I believe that every Japanese knows what to do if / when there is an earthquake. Enjoy your travels!,"as someone who also experienced something similar during the 1st Jan earthquake, Japanese people really know what to do and will always help out everyone during these emergency situations. My own takeaway is that in emergencies like these, follow along the closest Japanese resident if in public or listen to the staff in commercial places. No one gets left behind.","Currently on a trip in Iriomote Island and our experience is pretty much the same as yours. Just about to leave the hotel to pick up our rental car and the alerts came through on outlr phones of an earthquake and then the tsunami warnings came through. Initially the hotel staff said they were waiting for more information, then 5 minutes later called up the guests and escorted us to higher grounds. Very well organised and no panicking at all. Not something you want to experience on holiday but definitely a story to tell!","I was in Japan when they had the plane collision at Haneda airport. I couldn't believe nobody on the airliner died, the plane was literally on fire with the turbines spitting sparks. I think the fact that everyone on the airliner lived is because it was a Japanese crew with Japanese passengers. Nobody was trying to take their baggage with them down the slide, it looked orderly. Huge respect to the flight crew."
17ov5pu,Shinjuku Station Incident,"Quick rant: my spouse (m) and I (f) were  walking through Shinjuku station with a local friend (f) to grab lunch. As we walked by the west exit, an older Japanese man punched me hard in the ribs next to my right breast. It was a well aimed punch as I was wearing a small backpack, so he managed to hit just between my arm and bag as I walked by. 

I was shocked. When I turned to look, he raised both his fists and shook them in my face. In retrospect, I wish I'd grabbed his hands and yelled for a guard, but I just hurried away, and he disappeared into the crowd. 

My spouse was furious, and our friend wrapped her arm around me protectively for the rest of our walk through the station. I've never had an issue in stations or crowds before, and I'm careful to be polite and stay out of the way, so this was a first.

ETA: I didn't post this to scare anyone away from Shinjuku station or from traveling in Japan in general. I'm feeling a bit raw about it, that's all.",https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/17ov5pu/shinjuku_station_incident/,"Whoa I‚Äôm reading about how this is a thing in crowded places in Japan on another thread. Apparently these guys target women and if you hit them back or get physical you can be charged with assault. Most often they are found in crowded train stations. They will claim it was an accident. What BS. 

I would follow the guy and ‚ÄúBUTSUKARIYA‚Äù for like 10 full minutes while pointing at him. I have zero shame so I‚Äôm not even exaggerating.

Edit: I‚Äôm so sorry this happened to you and hope your ribs are okay. May the rest of your trip bring peace and happiness!",I was in Japan last month and had 2 guys shoulder check me (I'm a woman). After reading these replies I'm wondering now if it was on purpose.,"Unfortunately this has been a thing in Japan for quite a while now. For some twisted reason these people will punch random strangers (some of them target foreigners) knowing that they will most likely get away with it due to the victim being in shock. 

Sadly there is nothing much we can do about it. Usually the law and police would be stacked against foreigners, physically retaliation will land you into bigger trouble than the actual culprit. If it happens again the only thing you can do is yell for help and try to keep track of the culprit . Yelling ""butsukariya"" may help too","I live here and am a man.  Last month it was a woman in her 50s who kicked me in the back because she didn‚Äôt like that I was walking down the escalator. 

For context, there are posters up all over stations in Japan as a campaign against this. 

I told station staff, dashed after her taking a video for evidence and ran ahead of her into the police box.  

Despite her screaming that she hates all foreigners and wishes they‚Äôd be forced out of Japan, then openly admitting she‚Äôd assaulted me, the police, after berating me for recording her and belittling my perfectly acceptable Japanese level (as I had asked him to repeat a question he‚Äôd, I feel purposefully, asked at high speed to stump me - ‚Äúthis is Japan, I‚Äôve no obligation to speak slower‚Äù), gave me the option of being detained and questioned for a few hours (I‚Äôd told them I was in the town to see a concert starting 30 minutes later) or fully apologise, bowing to the perpetrator. 

Begrudgingly, all I could do was apologise, as I could only see the situation getting worse from there on in for me. 

I later consulted with a lawyer who confirmed that in such a case recording someone is not only perfectly acceptable, but his recommendation. 

The point is, ‚Äúpolice‚Äù here exist to protect Japanese. Not you. In any situation you‚Äôre already at an extreme disadvantage, even if you‚Äôre the victim.  The only viable course of action is to remove yourself from the situation immediately.",
dm596o,my advice: take your time and walk to places,"I was there for a month, I've been back for two weeks, I miss it.


I've seen so many itineraries for review. They're all packed full of amazing activities and sights - so many things worth seeing.


But be sure to take some time and slow down and walk places. The public transportation is amazing and tempting to take - but if it is less than two miles away - walk to it. There are so many neighborhoods, nooks and crannies, and slices of life to be seen.


We saw a croquette league for seniors. We saw a group of children trying to catch butterflies with nets. We found an old supermarket that had neon sighs for each of its sections. We found hidden hiking trails and vending machines where you'd least expect them. We found stores that aren't on google maps. We stumbled upon a brewer‚Äôs festival.


The highlights are great - but my best memories are of the little details that I stumbled on unexpectedly.

Edit: welp, this got popular and my grammar was awful, so I'm just cleaning it up. Thank you for the gold - it is the first I've ever received, and it made my day.",https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/dm596o/my_advice_take_your_time_and_walk_to_places/,I second everything said and would like to add getting good shoes with good support. I walked everywhere during my 7 day trip a few years back. Feet were killing me by the fourth day.,"But people think this means it's a good idea to have an itinerary that says ""Wander around, find a place to eat"" because they expect something magical to happen along the way. But in reality they're going to get frustrated and end up having a miserable time because they didn't plan at all. There's a happy medium between having every minute of the day planned out and having no plan.","also when looking for food using google maps, ZOOM IN. we found so many interesting places by not using the 'explore this area' button and instead zooming in to look for food icons. Google is not doing you a favor when they furnish those high point entries necessarily.","I agree with this sentiment fully. But I would probably decrease the distance to 1 mi.  If someone is on a 1 month long trip like you were I think it makes sense, but for someone there trying to see all they can in 10 days that may not be feasible (I know this won‚Äôt apply to some people with superhuman energy). Even taking the trains as much as possible and doing normal exploring, you can easily rack up 15-20 miles in a day. I do agree that some of the best moments are on foot wandering, so Definitley don‚Äôt spend all your time in taxis and trains","Yes, but in moderation.

My first three days in Kyoto I walked everywhere - from the station to Gion with my bags, to downtown, the whole Higashiyama area, walked a full day in Nara etc. Sunrise to sundown every day. And it was great, but I exhausted myself and was too tired to enjoy dinner or nightime.

After that, I realised that it's not a sin to take a taxi or a bus. To have an hour in the hotel halfway through the day. My second week has been much more relaxed, and I find that with a better tempo comes a more mindful appreciation of what you're seeing.

Also, having walked tons in Kyoto, Osaka, Himeji, Kanazawa, Shinjuku, and now Takayama, I have to be honest - 95% of the walk between places is just boring urban environment that you could see anywhere, with a slight Japanese twist. Once you get used to that Japanese element, there's little interesting there anymore. You aren't going to be having conversations with people randomly on the street.

And yes, especially in Kyoto, you'll stumble upon temples and shrines everywhere, but the truth is that the best ones really are the ones you'll find on the itineraries - that's why they're there.

If I could recommend one city that you walk around a ton, it would be Kyoto. And one that you use the transport - Tokyo."
1jhx37w,Shrine Closes Grounds to Tourists After Disrespectful Incident by Foreign Visitor,"Watadzumi Shrine of Tsushima's instagram post

\`\`\`  
As of today, Sunday, March 23, we hereby prohibit entry to the shrine grounds to all individuals except registered parishioners (*ujiko*) and devoted worshippers (*s≈´keisha*). This includes strict prohibition of all photography, video recording, and live streaming of any shrine buildings, structures, and objects, including the torii gate in the sea.

Furthermore, we will no longer permit entry for sightseeing purposes, including participation in domestic or international bus tours.

On Saturday, March 22, at around 4:00 PM, an extremely serious and unacceptable act of disrespect was committed within the sacred grounds by a foreign visitor.

Despite repeated consultations with the City Hall, the Tourism and Local Products Association, and the Nagasaki Prefectural Police, no resolution has been reached. Shrine staff have endured immense psychological distress from the repeated desecration of the sacred area, in addition to frequent verbal abuse and even acts of violence, leading us to a grave sense of crisis regarding the continued operation of this shrine.

The way in which inbound tourism is destroying the places, things, and people that Japanese have long cherished is nothing less than the erosion of Japanese culture itself.

We hereby express our deep regret and have decided to take this action to protect the shrine and the hearts of those who hold it sacred.

11tg8ts,Things I Wish I Had Known Before My 2 Week Trip To Japan!,"Here are some things that I wish I had known before I came, that I think can really make your trip the best it can be!

* When taking the subway to a location, use Google maps to identify the closest station exit to it and then use the internal station signs to find it and exit out that specific exit. For big stations especially, if you take the wrong exit, you may have to walk all the way around the station again, which is very slow!

* Japan is a maze. If you are looking for something specific (such as a restaurant) just following Google maps won't always get you there. Often you will find they are hidden within a building or underground. Give yourself  LOTS of time to find it.

* If you are still lost, look at reviews. The reviews in Google maps often give clues (such as that it's inside the ticket area of a station, or that it's underground etc). 

* The subways are also a maze. The different train lines from different companies often aren't in the same building. They are sometimes connected underground, follow the signs to them of they are, but they often aren't. In Google maps, I recommend selecting a route that has all of the train connections on the same line if possible, even if this adds 5-10 minutes to your trip, so that you don't have to spend time finding a new station.

* The convenience stores usually don't have seats to sit on to eat unlike Korea. Plan to eat at parks.

* Not all parks have seats, or much seating to go around. Some parks have leaning posts instead!

* We have never been able to check in earlier than our hotel check in time, not even five minutes earlier (true story) but we have been able to drop our bags just fine!

* Get to the station with LOTS of time if you need to use a ticket machine or need to line up to buy a ticket. The lines to use these can be HUGE. Sometimes you get lucky and it's empty. But usually, they are huge lines, and they don't move fast. 

* Check if the train you are about to board is a ""local"" train or a ""rapid"" train. The local trains stop at all stops and the rapid trains skip stops. This is great if you want to go somewhere quicker, but bad if your station is one of the missed stops (this has happened to us!). 

* The train to Disney gets extremely crowded. And then everyone lines up for the opening of the park, and the lines are huge and take a long time to move. You really want to aim to be there 1 hour earlier or more if you want to hit rope drop, and ideally, you want to be staying out that way in a hotel on the monorail loop.

* Shibuya and Shinjuku are loud and extremely busy. We stayed out in Tokyo Station area and it was perfect for us! So lovely and peaceful with plenty of options to eat around us. Even though Shinjuku and Shibuya are the areas everyone recommends, you may prefer a different area after all.",https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/11tg8ts/things_i_wish_i_had_known_before_my_2_week_trip/,"Regarding points two and three, if you tap on a place in Google Maps and scroll down slightly to the ‚ÄúAddress‚Äù section, it will often tell you if the place is in a building/department store and what floor it‚Äôs on. That‚Äôs often enough to clear up most of the confusion.",">Shibuya and Shinjuku are loud and extremely busy. We stayed out in Tokyo Station area and it was perfect for us! So lovely and peaceful with plenty of options to eat around us. Even though Shinjuku and Shibuya are the areas everyone recommends, you may prefer a different area after all.

Wander off the main drag in both these places and it quiets down substantially and very quickly.

I mean, relatively quiet. But you'll definitely find places that are a bit emptier once you're a few blocks away.","Google Map tip for the final walking part, click itinerary, walking and live view. Then scan around you and it will show big blue arrow to where you have to go. Had good success with it (and it likely work anywhere).

Yeah, sometimes finding a place require reading the address to see what floor, like Animate shinjuku is on the 6 or 7th floor of a department store, no big sign outside. Went to an exhibition that was on the 8th floor of a marui department store and the Google map pin was not on the right building (I suggested a change).","I just spent a month in Japan and this is all super accurate and great advice! If you‚Äôre looking for a restaurant that‚Äôs inside a big train station like Kyoto Station or Shinjuku, good luck. They are not easy to find!",
1bmo7o2,Getting threatened,"We arrived at our stay in Shinjuku earlier. Looks like it's a love hotel during the day. 

Two hours ago at midnight we got a call in our room from reception saying we had 3 people in our room and to 'come down right now'. We said we didn't and to let us sleep. An hour ago we got a call on our hotel phone from a man this time saying we called a girl to the room, we said we didn't. 10 mins ago a girl knocked on our door and we told her we didn't call her. She said she's calling the police. 

We got another call and the man said pay her or else he's sending security up to force us to pay. 

Right now we are not answering any calls and keeping the door locked. Anything else we can do?

e: The name is ""Hotel The Hotel"" in Shinjuku.

We tried calling the police but our phones couldn't connect the call and the call wouldn't go through on the hotel phone either. They didn't come back to our door to confront us again physically, thankfully. We didn't sleep but we left once the sun rose. The small hotel corridors are dark and cramped and we have a ton of luggage we'd be fumbling with so we wouldn't be able to make a quick escape at night while the threats were happening without possibly running into the hotel / prostitution company staff on the way out.

av924o,Friendly Reminder: Japan Exists Outside Tokyo & Kyoto,"I read an article recently about how Tokyo, Kyoto and Osaka are heavily overtouristed, and the problem seems to be getting worse, fraying the nerves of both visitors and locals. 

&#x200B;

I hope people could consider getting off the beaten tourist path a bit and going outside the ""golden highway"" between Tokyo and Osaka. There's plenty of locations in Japan that are absolutely beautiful, fun, and culturally enriching, which have very, very few foreign tourists (or any tourists at all, sometimes). All of the best experiences I've had in the country were away from the crowds.

&#x200B;

Here's some ideas, and if other people wanted to contribute some, maybe that would be cool and helpful to some folk :)

&#x200B;

Kyoto has plenty of beautiful temples, shrines, and gardens. But also plenty of tourists. Hirosaki and Kanazawa both have some excellent temples, shrines, and gardens, along with castle ruins at both. They're far less crowded and the people are very welcoming. 

For nightlife, Sapporo in the North and Fukuoka in the South, both have some great party areas with packed bars and excellent brew on tap. 

Day trips to Mt. Fuji are nice, but Mt. Aso in Kyushu (active volcano with huge, green caldera you can take a ropeway up to see), Mt. Hakodate in Southern Hokkaido (the view from the summit is the most stunning in the world at night), and Mt. Haku in Gifu, which is quiet yet beautiful.

If you really want to experience some of Japan's remote and unspoiled beauty, any of the cities and towns dotting the Sea of Japan (""other"" coastline) get practically no visitors from outside the country (aside from Niigata, and even that place is underrated). Tottori has amazing sand dunes with all the associated fun activities (sandboarding, paragliding, camel rides, and a local legend about a cursed woman). 

Or practically anywhere in Shikoku, which is basically the everyday Japan, without the hype. The prefectural capitals here all have museums, nightlife, attractions, and restaurants (geared towards locals instead of tourists, so higher quality and lower price). The towns and villages are full of friendly and interesting people, and the air is often so fresh it's intoxicating.

&#x200B;

I definitely don't want to slam Tokyo or Osaka; I love those places and everyone needs to check them out at least once in their lifetime. But dedicating part of your vacation to seeing some of Japan's less instagrammed places could be a really awesome experience, too :)",https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/av924o/friendly_reminder_japan_exists_outside_tokyo_kyoto/,"Excellent post, and nice specific examples as well. There are also lots of hidden gems in the Setouchi area (Onomichi, for example), that give a feel for the ""traditional Japan"" many people seek in Kyoto. Great seafood as well!","I'm sure everyone knows that, but not everyone has the time and money to visit Japan multiple times in their lives. So of course they're gonna visit the most popular 3 cities if it's their only chance. It's like telling a visitor to USA ""Don't just visit NY and LA! There are so many other cities!"". We know that too, but I'm not gonna book a flight to St Louis on my first visit to America even if it is a wonderful place.","I would definitely recommend Iga, Matsumoto and Sendai. All great places that I really enjoyed visiting ","I visited my relatives in Beppu this January , their onsens are amazing and the small city is filled with great food and amazing scenery ","I agree with everything, but also consider that Tokyo and Kyoto are very very beautiful and amazing, too. People who have never been will want to see it regardless. 

But unless you find something compelling that you want to do again, exploring the rest of Japan is also a great idea."
188a5x5,Got chikaned at a crowded konbini and didn‚Äôt react like I thought I would,"This happened about an hour ago and I‚Äôm still shaky. It‚Äôs so stupid. He squished his entire hand into my buttcheek, hard, for about a full second before I whipped around shocked with my eyes bulging and he acted like it was an accident and quickly walked away, even though we both knew it couldn‚Äôt have been an accident.

I didn‚Äôt do anything at all, unable to think of anything other than trying to convince myself it could have been an accident. I just stood there in the store shaking and shocked. He kept shopping for another couple minutes and heated up his food and left. I think he was drunk. He was inexplicably wearing the slippers provided by our hotel (the konbini is inside the hotel) even though it‚Äôs super cold, and are you even supposed to wear those outside the room?

I‚Äôm here semi-long term so I‚Äôve sort of practiced in my mind what I should do if this happened, and even though I never actually thought it would happen, I always had assumed if it did it would be on a train, and had also always assumed it would be my breasts, which would be harder to play off as an accident. I‚Äôd never planned what to do in this exact situation, so I just froze.

I hate it. I feel awful. I know this feeling will pass, but I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm going to be much more aware of keeping my butt protected from now on. I even hated the feeling of sitting down in the chair once I got back to my room because it reminded me of it. I feel like I‚Äôm being so dramatic too. I hate it.

b3wa3c,Just back from Japan. A few tips and tricks I hope help planners!,"Hello! I just returned from a 10 day trip to Japan in which we (my wife and I, both 33) visited Tokyo, Kyoto, and Osaka with day trips to Nara and Hiroshima. We are well-versed in International travel but we had a lot of anxiety for this trip. This subreddit was incredibly useful! I just wanted to throw out a few things I wish I knew or had been reassured-of before arriving rather than doing a ""trip review"" I see on here a lot.

* **You do *NOT* need a tour guide to visit Japan!**
My initial reaction to planning this trip was we should consider booking a guided tour because of the language and culture barriers. I am sure there are some benefits to being in a tour group but for us not having to be beholden to a schedule was much preferred and honestly, a guide was just simply not necessary because...
* **Not knowing Japanese is really not a problem.** 
Almost every important sign is in English. I can't think of a time we couldn't figure out how to do something (except order at some restaurants, more on that later)
* **Absolutely get a pocket wifi.**
We used Japan-wireless. Not a plug but it worked great for us. We picked it up at the airport and dropped it into a mailbox before we left. We've never had an international trip where we were so connected and worry free about data
* **Use Google Maps to get to all your destinations.**
It's almost embarrassing how much we relied on Google Maps. One of the biggest benefits is it tells you which platform to be on for most subways. This makes it so we don't have to stare at the line maps to figure out which direction we need to go. There were even times we doubted Google Maps and diverted, only to realize Google Maps was correct
* **Do some quick research on how to get to your hotel from the airport.**
Since you won't be totally confident in your knowledge of public transportation the moment your jet-lagged self steps off the plane, have confidence in how to get to your hotel. In our case, our hotel was right next to Shinagawa Station and we flew into Haneda. So I knew I needed to take the Keikyu express train to Shinagawa after buying and loading a Pasmo (or any IC card). Knowing this rather than fumbling through if I needed to take the Keikyu or the monorail and the difference between the two right when we landed was a huge help.
* **Get an IC card.**
This is obvious as everyone recommends it. We used it a ton. I probably spent close to $100 in various things on it and it makes the various subway companies so much easier
* **Get a JR Pass, if it makes sense.**
Somewhere online there's a website where you can enter your various destinations and it will tell you if the rail pass makes sense. It did for us, but just barely. But now I know that even if that site said it wasn't worth it, but by a small amount, I still would have gotten it. We used the JR lines quite a bit outside of the bullet trains.
* **If you get a JR Pass, reserve a seat when you can.**
This limits your flexibility but we came back from Hiroshima right after a baseball game ended. We ended up having to stand the entire 90-minute ride back to Osaka after a full day of exploring. This wasn't pleasant.
* **You need a hookup for high-end restaurants, or extra cash.**
Most of the nice restaurants do not have an online reservation system like OpenTable. They require someone who speaks Japanese to call during a narrow window of time. Usually only 4+ star hotels have concierges that can do this for you, and some of them require you to already be checked-in before they'll do it for you. There are a number of companies that will do this for you for a fee, often a big fee (like $40+ per person).
* **Don't stress over where to eat before you arrive.**
We booked a nice sushi dinner through our hotel's concierge ahead of time. So I worried about all our other meals. Normally I would mark down restaurants that looked interesting using TripAdvisor or yelp or something ahead of time. There are so many places in Japan these services just don't work well. When you're hungry, just think about what *kind* of food you want and there will probably be a great place somewhere nearby you can wander into
* **~~Day drinking is kind of not a thing in Japan.~~** **Getting alcohol drinks during the day without food is kind of not a thing**
When we travel, my wife and I are used to popping into bars or breweries in the middle of the afternoon to rest our tired feet and break up the day. While Japan has very relaxed drinking laws, most true bars don't open until the evenings and restaurants that serve alcohol expect you to order food along with your drink
* **If you love craft beer or cocktails, reconsider your drinking plans.**
Craft beer and cocktails are insanely expensive. Like, I'm talking 1400 yen (~$14) for a pint of craft beer. Expect to pay at least that for a high-end cocktail.
* **Highballs seem to be the ""locals drink of choice"" or at least a popular drink to order.**
This is an inexpensive (~500ish yen) cocktail of cheap whiskey and soda water. Everywhere you go knows how to make them and they drink easy. So it's good to know if you're somewhere without an English menu.
* **Use the Line chat group organized in the monthly meetups from this sub.**
We never ended up meeting up with anyone but it was awesome to get travel ideas and ask questions along the way.
* **Step outside of your comfort zone!**
I put this at the end because I think it's the most important. Before we arrived, I was very concerned about walking in to a bar or restaurant and embarrassing myself or offending the people inside. This was never the case for us. Our absolute best experiences came from us nervously walking into a bar that seemed like we wouldn't be welcomed. 
Specifically, I'll give a shoutout to a place called Bar Dram in Kyoto. It's on a second floor and the whole place is basically the size of a bedroom. We had a record scratch moment when we walked in and everyone looked at us like ""who the hell are these people"" but that was mostly because none of them spoke good English and were embarrassed by that. (Side note: we discovered that since basically everyone takes English in school, locals are embarrassed when they can't speak it anymore. Like, ""I don't want them to know I took a ton of English lessons and I didn't retain much of it"") But by the end of the night, we made friends with everyone. One of the patrons started crying because ""it was the best time she's ever had in that bar"" and the owner gave us a gift (some barware I had asked a question about). I'm not bragging about our social skills, in fact they are usually poor. All we did was ask questions and be patient when they tried to respond. 
We had at least two other occasions similar to this where we opened the door to a bar and instantly felt like we shouldn't be there and eventually had an amazing time. For instance, we walked into what we learned later is a very respected yakitori restaurant in Osaka. There was no English menu and the owners spoke no English. While considering our options, a young couple seated next to us asked in English if she could help us order. We told her to please order us their favorites (with no animal internal organs) and by the end of the night we were friends with them and the owners and it was one of the best meals of the trip. So if there's one thing from this to take away, do something that makes you uncomfortable on your trip; it may lead to the highlight of your vacation. And go to Bar Dram in Kyoto.

",">**Day drinking is kind of not a thing in Japan.**

&#x200B;

Disagree. While most bars might not be open, most restaurants will offer you beer any time of the day. I had sushi breakfast a number of times before 10:00 am and got a beer every time. My favourite moment came while I was snacking at the Tsukiji Outer Market and stopped for some eel skewers at around 7:00am, dude offered me a beer while I stood on the street with my eel. It was a great start to an awesome day.

&#x200B;",I'd also say don't be afraid of organs! I met up with a Japanese friend and she ordered chicken heart yakitori and it was awesome. I'd never eaten an organ before. I had a few beers first though.,There certainly is expensive craft beer but I have had many pints for far less than that. Less than 10 usd usually.,"Day drinking is a thing, but not in pubs. Grab a strong zero or a beer and sit down in a park. "
1csvmgh,I just got scammed in Osaka,"My family and I were walking around the Gilco sign, looking for a place to eat. We saw this guy holding a sign in the street for a restaurant with food that looked pretty good. 

It was pretty late, we were all tired, and we just wanted to some place to eat. So we asked the guy about the restaurant, and we ushered us into a building where my family of 6 squeezed into a tiny elevator into a dingy little restaurant. 

We were sat down and they asked if we wanted Japanese or English menus. I asked for English, which looking back was a huge mistake. We ordered just a couple of items, but solely through a QR code on the table, no servers came to us. When we just asked for water, they told us to order through the QR code, where were charged ¬•200 for each water. We assumed it was gonna be bottled water for that price, but it wasn‚Äôt. 

We finish up our meal, and I calculated it to be around ¬•6,000. When we went up to pay, they charged us ¬•10,580. I was confused because that‚Äôs not what the prices were based off the menu. The guy goes on about ‚Äútaxes‚Äù and says we need to pay the ¬•10,580. I‚Äôm tired, confused, and just end up paying the guy the money, and we leave.

16kzve0,There is a camera in my AirBnb in Tokyo. Is this normal or allowed?,"There is a camera at my AirBnb in Tokyo. It is a small studio apartment type deal and it is technically in the bedroom (although the bedroom is also the living space), however it is facing the ‚Äúentranceway‚Äù (where the main door is) so I am not sure if this is allowed?

Airbnb prohibits the use of cameras in the bedrooms and bathrooms but it is okay for the living space, however it is still technically the bedroom and the camera faces a big mirror, which I have definitely been fully nude in front of before I noticed the camera! They also did not disclose this camera anywhere on the listing or throughout booking.

1c2n7w2,Our trip to Japan,"I just finished a three-week trip to Japan. I sense that there is a lot of anxiety among people who have plans to travel to Japan, and so this write-up is an attempt to hopefully alleviate some of that. My precursor to this is that most all of this is subjective. It‚Äôs just what worked for us and everyone has different priorities and approaches to travel, obviously. Having said that, we‚Äôve traveled internationally extensively, and this was the best trip of our life.

First some details about our itinerary: we left from Denver and arrived in Tokyo on March 24th and were in Japan for a total of 18 days. We spent the first five nights in Tokyo, then four nights in Kyoto, five nights in Osaka (with three day trips to Nara, Himeji and Hiroshima, and Mount Yoshino), two nights in Fujiyoshida, and two nights in Tokyo on the tail end. I bought a DS and took Pok√©mon Soul Silver to play on the plane. It made the time go super fast and made me even more excited about Japan.

Hotels: Hotel Metropolitan Edmont (Tokyo), Sora Niwa Terrace (Kyoto), Mitsui Garden Premiere (Osaka), Hotel MyStays Fuji Onsen Resort (Fujiyoshida), and JR Blossom (Tokyo). All hotels were fantastic but my favorite stay was Sora Niwa. It was right across the river from Gion, had an awesome rooftop terrace, and on-site onsen. Kyoto was the destination we were most excited about, and so it was kind of a ‚Äúsplurge hotel‚Äù by our standards. Two of our hotels had onsite onsen, which was great after long days of walking. The hotels (especially in Tokyo) were very small and it was difficult to maneuver large luggage. My wife and I actually had separate beds at the JR Blossom (because only a double was available) and having the extra space for luggage and shopping was awesome.

Ultimately I felt like the number of days (18) we spent in Japan was just about perfect. It felt like we had time to settle into each location and explore at a steady pace, but none of our stops felt shortchanged. I didn‚Äôt leave anywhere wishing that we would have had more days. The cherry blossoms were sparse for the first week or so, but they really exploded around the time we hit Osaka. We took ¬•300,000 (approx. $2,000 USD) in cash and it was handy. Most all places took card except for the odd street vendor here and there, though my Visa cards were not working with setting up the transportation cards. Just don‚Äôt forget your cash in the hotel safe like me and you won‚Äôt have to rush from Tokyo Station back to your hotel and back to the station‚Ä¶

So now I‚Äôll start off with some macro-advice on mindset and approach to Japan.

First: Let. Things. Roll. Before leaving on our trip, I had a long conversation with one of my friends who spent several years living and working in Tokyo. He said that in his experience, the people who really enjoy Japan, are the ones who let things roll and go with the flow. That mantra was in the back of my mind the entire trip and allowed me to maintain a positive outlook even in ‚Äúfrustrating‚Äù situations. Sandwiched into a rush hour car in Tokyo? Let things roll. The restaurant you wanted has a long queue? Let things roll. Google Maps goes crazy and leads you astray when you arrive at a huge station? Let things roll.

Second: relatedly, not everything that you do in Japan needs to be the ‚Äúbest of.‚Äù Obviously you should branch out by trying unique foods and experiences, and hit the prominent tourist locations that are popular for a reason, but not every meal or site needs to be life changing or come from a prominent list or social media. Our favorite experiences were the things that we stumbled upon: an Italian restaurant in a back alley in Fujiyoshida (Kagashippo), a table tennis shop in Nara, a random temple we found from a hotel coffee table book in Kyoto, random rivers and streams lined with cherry blossoms, local art stores around Tokyo, listening to a guitar player by the river in Tokyo, and so on and so on. Find your own unique experiences and moments by heading down back alleys, walking instead of taking transit here and there, and interacting with Japanese people.

Third: be a good tourist. More on this later, but the treatment I observed from tourists toward Japanese employees, and towards other tourists, particularly in hotel lobbies and at popular photo spots, was absolutely absurd. Treat the Japanese workers kindly and try to engage with them, if you can. Attempt to communicate with them in Japanese before bombarding someone with a confusing English statement. It is not that hard to learn the twenty or so keywords that you‚Äôll need in most hotel and restaurant situations. If there was an upcoming interaction where I needed to say something, I would write it out in translate and try to quickly learn it on the fly. This wouldn‚Äôt always work, but I could sense that the effort was appreciated, and I felt like workers in tourism were more inclined to help me because of it. Telling ‚Äúoishi‚Äù (tastes good) to workers here and there goes a long way. 

Fourth: remind yourself to enjoy yourself. It‚Äôs ok to try and get some rest and relaxation. It is vacation, after all. I think there is a tendency to try and pack itineraries to the brink, especially in Japan where there is just so much to see. I have done this before on other trips and usually regret it. Of course, not everyone can take three weeks in Japan like us, but the couple of slower paced days that we had (which we planned to correspond with rain) were essential to recharge our bodies and minds. Getting that two hour nap to feel fresh for the next day was more valuable than crossing off another temple.

Now I‚Äôll go into some more specific advice on things that made my life much easier in Japan.

-Invest in a good pair of shoes. Do it. You won‚Äôt regret the up-front expenditure, but will certainly regret it if you start having foot issues shortly into the trip. Some of our friends went to Japan once and the woman had blisters all over her feet after two days. Not fun. 

-Get a physical transportation card if you can. We were able to acquire them from the JR counter at Narita Airport. This is not necessary, of course; it was just nice to be able to keep the card in my right pocket, take it out at the stations, and not have to worry about phone battery etc. You can ‚Äúcharge‚Äù them with cash at any convenience store.

-Phone: eSim purchased through the AirAlo app worked beautifully the entire trip. You just buy it and activate it right before leaving. For me it started working as soon as we passed through Japanese immigration (be prepared for a long line).

-Taking taxis to the tourist hotspots early in the morning was essential for us. In order to beat the crowds, we took taxis from our hotels to our list of ‚Äúmust see‚Äù spots that we knew would get busy. Those sites included: Senso-Ji in Tokyo, Ariyashima Bamboo Forest near Kyoto, Fushimi Inari in Kyoto, and Universal Srudios in Osaka. None of those rides (with the exception of Ariyashima, maybe) were more than ¬•4000. This method of transportation might not be for everyone, but for us, the calculation of spending $10-$20 USD to experience these places in complete peace and serenity, or start off the morning with more energy and comfort, was worth it.

-Try to get going early in general. Even if you aren‚Äôt a super early riser, I noticed that each hour at popular spots gets progressively busier. For example, we took a day trip to Nara from Osaka. We arrived at Nara Park around 8:00 a.m., and it was relatively peaceful, serene, and ‚Äúnormal‚Äù for a couple of hours. Then sometime around 10:30 a.m. the area simply exploded with people. 

-Get a power bank, keep it charged, and take it with you. We had an Anker power bank, and the thing was a life-saver. Navigating around the cities, researching sites, taking photos, and pulling out your phone for transportation eats up a lot of battery quickly. With the power bank we could use our phones at our leisure and never had to worry about running out of battery. Of course you can always find a coffee shop or station to charge your phone, but it‚Äôs much easier to just plug it in and keep exploring.

-Luggage forwarding is essential. This was something I‚Äôd read about before leaving for Japan, and I didn‚Äôt anticipate needing or wanting it. But after hauling our carry-ons, backpacks, and a large suitcase from Narita to our hotel in Tokyo, I needed it more than I needed water. A sub-tip is that you can send luggage one destination in advance, that is, skipping a destination. For example, we were in Osaka, from there we had two days in Fujiyoshida, but we sent the luggage from Osaka to the next hotel in Tokyo. It was there waiting for us in our room when we arrived. Very nice. In my experience the cost was approximately ¬•2000 per bag per time, and I don‚Äôt regret a single cent of it. Edit thanks for kind reply: or just pack lightly, do laundry (easy) while there, and buy a suitcase in Japan for souvenirs.

-I found some of the perceptions of Japan to be overblown. Finding a nice, clean bathroom was never an issue. Much harder in Europe, in my personal experience. Disposing of trash was never an issue. Sometimes we would carry it down the street for a while, but you eventually come across a disposal. People generally respect the crosswalk lights, and we did, but it won‚Äôt shatter the earth it someone crosses without a walk signal.

-This one may be controversial and put me in an extreme minority, but I preferred Apple Maps to Google Maps. I just like the user-interface of Apple Maps better and find it easier to use. I am the primary navigator (my wife has navigational‚Ä¶issues), and I used Apple Maps for the entirety of the trip. It did not lead me astray, though sometimes I would cross-check more remote addresses on Google. All of the train lines and times were totally accurate. I understand that this is subjective, but try it‚Ä¶you may like it!

So those are my general tips. Here are some of the highlights of our trip:

My personal highlights: 

-The day-to-day interactions with the Japanese people. Engaging with the Japanese people was an absolute pleasure. Whether it was the old man on our first train ride who recognized that we were tourists and tried his best to wish us a good time in English. Or the man who was sitting next to us at the Tokyo Swallows baseball game who gifted us a Swallows ‚Äúumbrella‚Äù (the fans lift umbrellas when the team scores a run). Or the man who chased me out of a train to hand me a souvenir bag I‚Äôd forgotten. Or the guy in McDonalds who noticed that I was struggling to order an extra barbecue sauce and approached me by saying ‚Äúmay I help you kind sir, it would be my pleasure.‚Äù I get teared up thinking about it. It goes on and on. Just lovely and respectful people.

-Our ‚Äúprivate‚Äù sushi experience. One of those ‚Äúgo with the flow‚Äù decisions, we had sushi at the restaurant in the basement of our hotel in Tokyo (hotel metropolitan Edmont). There was nobody else in the restaurant and the chef prepared the dinner menu right in front of us. Everything was so fresh and delicious.  Could there have been better, or cheaper, sushi alternatives? I‚Äôm sure of it, but for us, it was the sushi experience of a lifetime.

-Daigo-ji Temple in Kyoto. This was by far my favorite temple in Japan. The zen garden, the pagoda, the grounds, all of it.

-Himeji Castle and Koko-en. This was my favorite morning of the trip. We got to Himeji early and walked the area surrounding the castle. The cherry blossoms were exploding. Then we found a zen garden nearby with the best display of Koi fish that we saw in Japan. It was so tranquil and serene and the whole thing felt like it wasn‚Äôt even real.

-Mount Yoshino. This was the only ‚Äúreal‚Äù hike that we did in Japan and it was so memorable. The fact that it was peak cherry blossom viewing was the distinguishing factor, though. It took us probably 90 minutes to meander up the mountain from Yoshino Station early in the morning, and it was already packed with Japanese people enjoying their weekend. The pathway is lined with shops and stands, and on the way down the mountain I decided to booze (unlike me) and had an absolute blast. It was liberating to drink openly in a setting like that. Looked like there were lots of neat traditional Japanese inns on the mountain.

-Meiji Jingu shrine in the early morning. I walked from our hotel to Meiji Jingu at around 6am and it was just beautiful. The monks were out sweeping and there were maybe five other people in the grounds.

-Japanese baseball. We went to a Tokyo Swallows game at Meiji Jingu Stadium. Even if you don‚Äôt enjoy baseball, I think anyone would enjoy the atmosphere and environment at a Japanese baseball game. They are just so passionate about it and it‚Äôs a beautiful thing to behold. The stadium was clean and even the ‚Äústadium prices‚Äù for food and beer were reasonable. It was everything that American baseball should be. Get tickets to Japanese baseball. You won‚Äôt regret it.

There are too many highlights to list in details. Those are just a few of things that had an impact on us. Almost all of it was amazing. Some others:

-Pok√©mon Center hunting and Pok√©mon card hunting in Tokyo

-Andaz rooftop bar (awesome cocktails and view but very expensive comparatively)

-TeamLab Planets

-Shibuya Crossing from above 

-Gyoen National Garden

-Senso-Ji

-Kyoto samurai experience 

-Kinkaku-ji

-Pipiko (awesome a la carte taco bar in Kyoto, go on Tuesday‚Äôs for a discount)

-Lake Kawaguchiko walk to Oishi Park

-Feed the deer in Nara Park

-Hiroshima Peace Museum and A-bomb Dome

-Arashiyama Bamboo Forest

-Nintendo World at Universal Studios


The lowlights:

-Kabukicho. After checking out the lights and wandering around for a few minutes I was done with Kabukicho. I didn‚Äôt like the vibe there and felt‚Ä¶unsafe on some of the less-busy streets. It was definitely an outlier in terms of areas we visited in Japan. It didn‚Äôt help that I slipped and fell on a massive pile of vomit while walking through a huge crowd near the station.

-Minions at Universal. My wife really wanted to go on this ride and so we waited two hours in line. The ride itself was a letdown in my opinion. Lots of talking and instructions in the lead-up just to sit in a stationary car for a couple minutes. 

-Other tourists. I can‚Äôt complain about the amount of tourists or crowds themselves, since we were there contributing to the number of people. Yes, it‚Äôs busy, particularly at peak travel times. But the actual behavior at popular tourist locations, ‚ÄúInstagram spots‚Äù, and hotel lobbies is depressing. 90% of people are totally fine and polite, but there were far more obnoxious and annoying tourists that I expected. I try not to generalize, but my observation was that the Americans actually got along pretty well and treated the Japanese well. 

I found the English, however, to be a complete international embarrassment. Here are some experiences with English tourists:

-lady yelling at a female Japanese hotel clerk because she wanted to check in at 2:30pm and check-in wasn‚Äôt until 3pm.

-English ‚Äúphotographer‚Äù at Yasaka Pagoda (Kyoto) telling a Japanese delivery guy to move his car out of the street since it was in shot 

-lady calling me out for quickly passing in front of her camera lens

-group of English guys drinking on the train and being loud and obnoxious and clearly annoying Japanese locals 

-group of English women essentially trying to get a hotel clerk with poor English to book every experience and restaurant for them in Kyoto

That‚Äôs what I can recall off the top of my head. That, and any English person that I happened to be nearby was complaining about something. No sense that they enjoyed being there or appreciated it whatsoever. 

So yeah, not sure what‚Äôs going on in England, but it was kind of amazing to me.

My advice would be to people-watch at these tourist hotspots. It‚Äôs pretty funny, though sad, to see ‚Äúinfluencers‚Äù all glitzed up for what they thought would be an easy photo shoot in front of some Japanese icon, then to watch the visible look of frustration on their faces when they realize that they‚Äôre just not gonna get the perfect shot they want. I‚Äôm a huge proponent of taking pictures and preserving memories, and of just doing whatever you like in general so long as it doesn‚Äôt disturb others, but don‚Äôt make photos the end-all-be-all of these spots. Just try to laugh at the absurdity of everyone taking pretty much the exact same photo a million times over. And, pro-tip, take the photos you want, and if, gasp, some people are in the background, head over to r/photoshoprequest and they‚Äôll fix it for you.

Anyway, that‚Äôs what I have to say about Japan and our time there. For us, it was an absolutely beautiful time and an experience we will cherish forever. There were several times that it would randomly just hit me ‚Äúyou‚Äôre in Japan right now‚Äù and it would make me well up a bit. I think that the best way to experience it is to have a loose itinerary with a willingness to be spontaneous and free. I hope that something in here helps you or impacts your trip to Japan in a positive way. Don‚Äôt miss it. Let things roll.",https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1c2n7w2/our_trip_to_japan/,"For anyone who has toilet needs, Japan is a godsend. Free clean public toilets abound. 

When I travel abroad, I always have to have coins in my pocket to pay for toilets that are not necessarily clean anyway. Some countries I have to carry my own toilet paper, or I can‚Äôt even expect a seat on the toilet (looking at you Italy)","This is definitely one of the best trip reports I‚Äôve read in a while. 

I 100% agree with your 4 key points particular the first 2.

Something didn‚Äôt work out for you? It‚Äôs most likely not the end of the world. It‚Äôs gonna rain all day?  Find a museum or an art gallery or spend some time at a mall, or just get a 700 yen umbrella and get out there anyway. 

People should stop worrying so much about checking off a list from the ‚Äútop liked things to see/do/eat‚Äù.  Even a bad meal will be memorable later because it was the exception to the norm. 

@OP - we did the season opener for the Tokyo Swallows game. What a fantastic vibe. The umbrellas and the girls with the beer keg backpacks!!!  It was definitely o e of the trip highlights for us and I don‚Äôt even watch baseball at home.","I really enjoyed what you've shared, thank you for all of your tips and experiences.","Great review. Yeah, people should really do their due diligence before visiting another country and act accordingly. After tourists are guests. You wouldn't like to receive a guest into your house who behaves like he/she owns the house.

Most of my bad experiences when traveling was also because of another tourists, local people usually treat us really kindly.",

Hey guys, I‚Äôm not in Japan or planning to go soon. But a person I care about went and now she‚Äôs missing, so we‚Äôre looking for help to find her. She was last seen around Osaka. Help.

These are the word of her son: 
‚ÄúMy family and I urgently need your help. My name is Murphy Murad, daughter of Patricia Wu-Murad, a U.S. citizen who has gone missing while hiking the Kumano Koto trail in Japan. My mother was reported missing to local authorities on Monday evening, April 10, and despite a 72-hour search and rescue effort, she has yet to be found. Our family was notified by the U.S. Embassy on Thursday, April 14, and we are desperate to find her.

We have been pleading with local authorities to continue the search, but unfortunetly, we have had zero luck. We now need to take matters into our own hands, hire a private search and rescue mountain crew‚Äù

Please share with your community and help us finding Pattie.


She was last seen leaving Mandokoro hostel Monday, April 10th. The plan was to hike the Kumano kodo trail, but she never made to the next hotel. 

Miura-toge pass is the specific trail she was supposed to be in. That‚Äôs the trail that connects the place she was to the next accommodation.

Also, apologies for the description formatting - Reddit doesn't allow paragraphs in tables.

## Note for Casual Coffee Drinkers

I write this mostly for people who love coffee and want to explore some of the specialty coffee scene in Tokyo.

Some of these places are out of the way and/or quite expensive. If you have no interest or only a passing interest in coffee, I'd say most of the things on this list aren't really places to drop into.

But coffee I would recommend for the casual drinkers out there - either from this list or just other stuff I've had:

* Cafe Reissue - very fun
* Higuma Coffee and Doughnuts - good doughnuts and a good location
* Fuglen - two good locations, good vibes
* Sarutahiko - generally okay, decent chain that you'll find all throughout Tokyo
* Streamer Coffee Company - they have multiple locations around the Shibuya/Harajuku area. Not exactly my preferred style, but they have great latte art and are very Starbucks-y

|**Description**|This coffee shop was founded in 1948 and is an old-school kissaten. Staff are very nice, space is a little cramped, but they make some great coffee using Hario Nel cloth drippers. For their drip coffee, they will give you options of making it ‚Äòlight‚Äô, ‚Äòmedium‚Äô, or ‚Äòstrong.‚Äô This is how concentrated the resulting coffee will be - if you like espresso, even ‚Äòstrong‚Äô isn‚Äôt particularly strong, to give you an idea. I really like to drink their coffee with a little alcohol - they have a selection of liquor on the menu like brandy. And the Queen Amber - highly recommended if you like a cold, sweet coffee drink.|

Atmosphere is chill, with music playing, mixed with the sounds of the Toyoko Line running about 15 feet away from you. Can get pretty busy - it‚Äôs a place for locals and college students to hang out, and is famous enough to draw international coffee enthusiasts. The espresso was well made, very citrusy and medium brightness. Chocolate and syrupy in the middle and mouthfeel. Americano was diluted to roughly 9 oz of liquid, more than my personal preference but this lowered the brightness and brought out more orange peel notes, something like a hint of floral taste, and a bittersweet chocolate. The finish was mildly acidic, lightly buttery (like the finish of a cup of cocoa). It still had a pretty rounded mouthfeel.|

|**Description**|Machine is a La Marzocco FB80. This place has somewhat of a reputation of being maybe a little curt, because it‚Äôs pretty no-nonsense. I felt the staff member was nice enough. The shop is a little small and there are a few outside seats. I‚Äôve had multiple espresso shots and macchiatos here. If you like your coffee fast and traditional, this is a very good option. Very chocolatey, the base espresso is robust and developed, more medium-dark to bring out deep chocolate notes. Very long finish with a bitter chocolate aftertaste.  The macchiato cut this darkness down and made it more palatable to me, and the latte art was very nice, especially given that it‚Äôs done in a demitasse. If the owner is at the shop, you must try the special menu, which has an item on it called The Angel Stain. It‚Äôs 800 yen and basically a super ristretto, like you‚Äôll only end up getting a splash of espresso in a cup. The other staff will not make the special drinks.|

|**Description**|This is a very stark place a few blocks away from Bear Pond. I had to visit them since it‚Äôs a ‚Äúnewer‚Äù style Ogawa Coffee similar to what we have in Boston. Unlike the Ogawa Coffees in Kyoto or Boston this place doesn‚Äôt do food aside from a small selection of baked goods (looks to be scones). Drinks are espresso, pour over, Aeropress, and you pick from a selection of coffee beans. Service is friendly, the staff do know some English, and all the coffee selections are in English and Japanese with a corresponding ‚Äúflavor wheel‚Äù identifying what each coffee would be. I asked the barista for what he‚Äôd recommend for something that‚Äôs acidic and sweet and I got the El Salvador Los Alpes. Pour over is made with ceramic Kalita 155s. Coffee was nice, just a tinge of acidity in the finish, with front sweetness and juiciness, lots of red fruit notes (the card indicated red grape and cherries).|

You get your choices of style (I got a Cardamom) and I got some lokum to go with it. Sugar levels of 0-3 (I got a 1). Owner is super friendly, coffee had a good balance of spice and just a tinge of sweetness at sugar level 1. Paired very nicely with the lokum, aftertaste of sweets and cardamom. Very good coffee, it changed my mind about Turkish coffee.|

|**Description**|This is a big name in the specialty coffee scene - they‚Äôre a perennial contender for the roasting championship of Japan. I went here multiple times, had multiple espresso and pour overs. Had an Ethiopia Chelektu which was like an acidic face punch, lots of citrus and lemon peel up front, with trailing notes of brown sugar, sweet clean finish, medium aftertaste. Also had an Ethiopia Aricha as a pour over with extremely powerful blueberry notes, made in a v60; as it cooled it gave way to more earthy notes like dark chocolate and what was herbaceous notes (couldn‚Äôt put my taste on it). Place also serves food (which I didn‚Äôt have), desserts (I like the Tokyo cheesecake), and is also a bar with beer on tap, as well as liquor. Equipment was Linea PB and Mythos.|

|**Description**|This place turns the Mameya concept into a full coffee shop and bar, with a central space surrounded by a counter that sits about 30. The coffee selection is the same list as the one at Koffee Mameya, so if you want the coffee shop experience and to also buy the beans, you can forgo waiting in a potentially massive line at Mameya Omotesando. They will make you espresso, pour over (Kalita Wave 155), milk drinks, and they have cold brew. They also make coffee cocktails. I opened with a double espresso from Coffee Collective, a Halo Washed Ethiopia. Very high acidity and juicy mouthfeel, lots of tart berry notes. I followed it up with a Black Cat cocktail which was made with ‚ÄúRaspberry Candy‚Äù cold brew (from Ona Coffee), imo shochu (Yamaneko), verjus, honey, and tonic. Had a nice front taste of chocolate from the coffee, and a lot of grape taste. I finished with a pour over of Momos La Montana Geisha, natural Peruvian. The coffee had a lot of amber honey notes, a lot of sweetness but also that earthy sweetness, quite different from a lot of Gesha that tends to be very floral.|

## THROUGHOUT TOKYO

These excellent coffee shops are a little more out of the way.

Gear was Linea PB, NS Mythos, Mazzer‚Ä¶something (Robur S or Major V, one of those). Had an espresso, and pour over of Colombia Gesha from Nicolas Hernandez. our over was quite good, fruity, raspberry notes, pleasant finish of black tea. I got a note kind of like a butter cookie in the middle. A little more interesting than other Gesha I‚Äôve had lately. Very juicy mouthfeel. As it cooled the notes that opened up were more citrusy and floral, like lemon peel and orange blossom. Espresso was their house blend and was a little acidic but more reminiscent of more traditional espresso, slightly ashy finish, very heavy mouthfeel, almost like syrup. It was pulled as a single (didn‚Äôt see an option for double). Has seating for maybe 14-16 and can get busy (was there on a Sunday afternoon) but is otherwise quite chill and relaxed as an atmosphere.|

It‚Äôs actually in Kinshicho, which is rather out of the way in terms of where people would probably go, as it‚Äôs mostly an area for residents - it‚Äôs a shopping area and has a busy nightlife area. Anyway, the coffee shop. It‚Äôs very chill, would probably sit 12 or so inside (three 2-tops, has a long bench-like seat). They don‚Äôt seem to do straight up espresso, only drinks made with espresso. I had a pour over of their house blend coffee and it was very nice - heavy chocolate notes mixed with fruit, I got light acidic red fruit like a hint of cranberry/raspberry. Also something reminiscent of black tea. Made in an Origami dripper. Their espresso gear is an LM Strada 2 group and a Mazzer grinder. Their pour over beans are ground with an EK43.|",https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/162ae85/a_short_guide_to_specialty_coffee_in_tokyo/,"This is great.

bsubm7,A very important tip for Fushimi Inari,"We went up Fushimi Inari this week and really enjoyed it. BUT I have an urgent warning for those making the trek:

When you reach the big ""crossroads"" area, with the wonderful view of Kyoto, you may be tempted to get ice cream. The only ice cream available at that station is vanilla; soy bean flour; or vanilla mixed with soy bean flour. 

If either of those is EXACTLY what you want, then go ahead and get some!

But you should know: if you continue up the mountain just a couple more minutes, there's another stand. And that one has ice cream in LOTS of flavors: chocolate, cookies and cream, citrus, soda, mint, strawberry... (I'm going by memory here but I'm pretty sure that list is accurate.)

Don't settle for soy bean flour if you'd rather hold on a tiny bit longer for something else!

This has been a public service announcement.",https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/bsubm7/a_very_important_tip_for_fushimi_inari/,"Or you know, just get ice cream twice ;)",What I got out of this is that every day multiple ice cream salesman have to hike Fushimi inari for hours to sell ice cream,"Or the most important tip of all: arrive before 8am and reach the top as people are just starting to swarm the base and that first crossroads. 

That way it‚Äôs not crowded until you‚Äôre done with most of the trip.",This is a very important tip and I love it.,[deleted]
yzoky8,A Brief Guide to OTC Cold and Cough Medications in Japan,"With Japan's re-opening and the upcoming winter, I'm going to go over some common cold and cough medicines found in Japan's drug stores. These are all over-the-counter medications that you can pick up a most drug stores throughout the country.  Matsumoto Kiyoshi (MatsuKi, „Éû„ÉÑ„É¢„Éà„Ç≠„É®„Ç∑) is possibly the most noticeable drug store, with its big yellow and blue signage, but there are many others, too. More generally, drug stores will have this kanji often listed outside: Ëñ¨ (medicine). Note that you cannot buy medicine at convenience stores. At best, they might have throat lozenges or non-medical powders for stomach aches, but they don't sell anything with medical ingredients.

# General Notes

* This guide is meant to help travelers who are experiencing mild symptoms or who are perhaps in a drug store and don't know what to do (the pictures and translations below should help ‚Äî you can also show them to the staff!). **If you are very sick or feel that you need medical attention, the Japanese government has [a guide that can help](https://www.jnto.go.jp/emergency/eng/mi_guide.html).**
* The guide below details a few prominent medications. It does not cover all medications available. Some of these medications also have different versions with slightly different ingredients meant to target different symptoms. I picked the most ""general"" of the options when I could.
* I did not translate the entire box for these medications. Below, I've listed ingredients, usage, dosage, and any important notes. If you need more specifics for info like allergies or aversions, this is not a guide that can help you.
* Given the ingredients of these medications, almost all recommend that you take them with food.
* Almost all of these medicines contains forms of codeine and/or ephedrine, ingredients which are often **not considered OTC medications in other countries**. Be careful when taking leftover pills out of the country, and **make sure to adhere to your next/home country's medication laws**.
* **This guide is not medical advice!** It is simply meant to help you read and understand the packaging of Japanese OTC medications if you are looking for cold symptom management. If you have a complex medical history, or you take medications that interfere with these ingredients or others, always be careful when selecting OTC meds.

# SS Bron B Caplets („Ç®„Çπ„Ç®„Çπ„Éñ„É≠„É≥ B)

[FRONT OF BOX](https://imgur.com/hDGLM8K) | [BACK OF BOX](https://imgur.com/LKDYE3T) | COUGH MEDICINE  (STRONG)

SS Bron is exclusively a cough medicine. It is very strong, and contains more dihydryocodeine than other things on this list, which means it has quite a bit of a drowsy effect. I wouldn't recommend SS Bron unless you are suffering a serious cough, and you should be careful when combining it with other medications (especially ones that also contain dihydryocodeine). In most drug stores, this product will be on the shelves, but you will likely need to speak with a pharmacist at checkout and answer a series of questions before they will let you buy it, as it is often abused and more strictly controlled because of that.

For an adult, you take 4 pills 3 times per day. The dosages on the ingredients listed below are for 12 pills (a full day's worth), so divide by three to get the per-dose amount. **Note: SS Bron also comes in a liquid form.**

First off I was worried that I would get lots of stares, nasty looks, and outright discrimination from my largely trim hosts  While I'm not the most observant person, I found this to actually not be the case whatsoever.  I can't recall once getting a nasty look or comment from anyone.  I felt perfectly normal and I fit in completely fine.

Second, I found a lot of the spaces in restaurants, izakayas, public transport much smaller than usual, but perfectly fine to navigate.  I wasn't dissuaded from visiting anywhere because I wouldn't fit- though sitting on tatami mats several times for a tea ceremony and a meal proved incredibly uncomfortable.

Third, it was dismaying, though certainly not unexpected, that I couldn't purchase clothing of any kind anywhere in Japan.  If I soiled a shirt at teppanyaki or after eating taco bell, I had to wear it on my shirt all day for everyone to see.  I couldn't rent a kimono/yukata and take cute pictures because I was too large, I couldn't buy any pokemon shirts at the Pokemon Center, or anything like that, either. That was a bit of a downer that might normally be overlooked.

But my final 'large person' observation is the biggest one of all, and that is that despite knowing full well ahead of time what I was in for, the sheer amount of walking and stair climbing and hiking was far, far too much for me, and it ultimately took a lot away from my trip.  Let me explain before everyone jumps on me for all the various reasons.

When you book a hotel ""4 mins walking"" q(according to Google Maps) from Shinjuku station, it's actually more like 34.  I pick Shinjuku because while most people already know it is the busiest station on earth, you don't actually know how completely fucking labyrinthine this place is- or how most stations are- for that matter.  You have to leave many stations just to walk to another one where your connecting line is.  I don't know how Google Maps calculates its estimates but they are always WILDLY misleading for any newcomer to Japan.   It seems to assume that you can read every sign, can anticipate every single random hallway you enter thinking it's your exit, that there is no foot traffic, etc.  It must also assume that youre already at street level because it can be the only explanation for why it is always a 7 minute walk to your destination, but it's actually 30.

And this is the case everywhere you go in the big cities.  You think it's 45 minutes to the Tokyo Dome from your hotel which is right next to Shinkuku Station (this is why you booked the hotel here, after all) but it's always- always an hour+.

So now you'd like to take a breather somewhere and just sit.  Think again!  There is scarcely a seat to be found ANYWHERE, least of public spaces like shrines or even parks and especially at the train stations.  The seats in restaurants are mostly small stools and tiny chairs and it doesn't seem to be any secret that you aren't meant to sit down anywhere.  It's a phenomenon that I don't understand but is clearly engrained in the Japanese culture

Now for people who love walking and who are fit and love adventure, all of this may sound fun, even exhilarating to an extent.  But to a large person like me it was more agony and disheartenment as the day wore on, and this invariably affected my husband's enjoyment of his trip, which is the next thing I learned.  

The mismatch in activity levels between my partner and I sucked for both of us.  I found myself often becoming a hindrance to him because he would want to go out and do things while I simply couldn't bear it, and he felt like he was leaving me behind.  Obviously if you are traveling to Japan solo this point will be moot, but if you're traveling with anyone who insists on filling every second of their vacation with taking in all Japan has to offer, you're just not going to be able to keep up and you need to be ready for that reality.  Allow them the space to go out alone if they so wish and don't be ashamed or 'feel like you missed out' by staying at the hotel and chilling on your vacation if you need to.  

So that's my little bit of insight as to my experience as a large person visiting Japan.  I am so glad I went and saw all the amazing things I saw, and thankfull to live out a dream, but I just probably wouldn't visit again because the difficulty came too close to outweighed (no puns, please) the reward.",https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/133tb5e/a_few_things_i_learned_as_a_large_person_from_my/,**Fair Warning - Anyone with snarky takes on folks of any size travelling in Japan are going straight to a full ban. Period.**,"All stations have special exits. Your exit will determine if you have to walk five minutes or thirty. If you've been there a while, you'll get to the point where you actually know which train car to choose, so that you're as close to your exit as possible.

Unless you know the station well, do NOT ""just get out"" and hope to figure out where you're going. Youll walk literal miles in big stations. 

You can also choose smaller stations nearby your destination., such as Higashi/Nishi/Minami Shinjuku instead of Shinjuku. Station exits tend to be roughly ten minutes walk apart from each other. Sometimes, that guarenteed three-to-five (at most ten) extra minutes is worth avoiding the chaos of a larger station, especially during rush hour, or otherwise the 30+ minute wander of shame.

You also learn what exits are a five minute walk uphill versus an eight minute walk downhill. For example, Omotesando is a great choice for someone who wants to explore the fancier streets of Harajuku but doesn't want to walk uphill after going through Takeshita.","For anyone who may be traveling soon, I would recommend Google maps for your station navigation. Don't just put the train stations you need in Google Maps, though. Put your current location and your final destination (i.e. Sensoji Temple instead of Asakusa Station) Google maps will then tell you which exit to take as well as which section of the train is closer. This can help save you walking several blocks to find your destination","Very thoughtful and informative post. 

Even as a Japan-average sized individual, I think your remarks are useful for anyone not accustomed to Tokyo. 

Sitting on tatami mats for dinner can be uncomfortable for the uninitiated. Similarly, your experience with Google maps makes a ton of sense. 

You do learn the system over time, such as identifying in advance how to get to the exit you need. But yes, for the newcomer, budgeting an extra 15 min (or more) just to make your way through bigger stations makes sense. 

I‚Äôm glad you braved the physically demanding streets to explore. You do get used to it, it‚Äôs a workout. By a few weeks you do get stronger. But regardless of your weight, depending on your fitness, expect to find yourself needing rest (and not finding a place to sit) when exploring the city. 

The advice just to chill and enjoy your hotel room or maybe a nearby cafe is a very good one. Nothing beats sitting in a Tokyo cafe with an iced coffee and a few books or magazines for a few hours. The parks are also perfect for this, if the weather cooperates (which it almost never does‚Ä¶)

I do hope you come back and explore Tokyo again on your own terms. Over the years I‚Äôve developed habits, like just stopping into one of the many generic British-style pubs just for one drink, or a revolving sushi joint just for a few plates just to sit and recharge for a bit. During off-hours, these places are often fairly empty, and just partaking slowly (but reasonably) is very comfortable. Back in the day, the video game arcades were great for stopping and sitting for an hour or so. The best way to enjoy Tokyo, IMHO, is just to enjoy being in Tokyo.","Japan can be overwhelming in that sense, yes.

Also you can‚Äôt really stop as there‚Äôs not many places to sit abs everyone is just constantly moving.

I love it since I‚Äôm a pretty fit guy but I understand how hard it can be."
z63zw6,"Don‚Äôt lose your Japan Rail Pass and then be an idiot, like me","I am currently in Japan and just did the most idiotic thing of my life. 

Yesterday I lost my Japan Rail Pass (very easy to do since it is just a small paper ticket) and needed to go on a bullet train today from Osaka to Tokyo. The passes are not able to be recreated so I was told I would need to by my ticket at full price, which is around $100 (the whole 7 day pass was less than $300). 

I was very upset and didn‚Äôt want to pay for the new ticket so I decided to only pay for 1 stop ($10) and would tell the  the security officer in Tokyo that I left my rail pass on the train and convince him to let me through. Well, foreshadow, that didn‚Äôt work at all.

I boarded the train and got all the way to Tokyo, but when I tried to get out of the station, the security officer didn‚Äôt care that I lost my pass and said I would need to pay for the full price of the fare. At this point, I kept digging the hole of lies deeper and told the officer that I only got on at the last stop so that I would only have to pay another $10 instead of the full $100. 

The officer asked for proof I came from that station, but I didn‚Äôt have any to offer. He said if I was lying and entered at a different station he would call the police, but I thought there would be no way for them to know and called their bluff.

Well as it turns out, the Japanese are very high tech and were able to use facial recognition from security footage to track me and showed me the video of me boarding at the Osaka station. They said they were calling the police and I apologized. In the end, they never called the police but made me pay a $200 fine in addition to the full $100 fare. 

It‚Äôs actually very impressive how they were able to track me down, but I was scared shitless. Honestly, I feel like I got off lucky because I really thought I was going to jail.

TL;DR I lost my rail pass, then lied about having a ticket to Tokyo to the security officer. I then got caught with facial recognition tech and had to pay a fine. Don‚Äôt lose your rail pass and be an idiot like me.

P.S throwaway account obv",https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/z63zw6/dont_lose_your_japan_rail_pass_and_then_be_an/,"Let that be a lesson for people trying to get away with *gaijin smash* with regard to major railway lines.

Railway stations, train and subway cars in Japan are under heavy survaillance and are connected to facial recognition capable systems.

Also it's worth noting that showing contrition goes a long way in Japanese legal system.",,,,
16ls1jx,Introvert's Dream: A Stress-Free & Luxurious Japan Getaway üáØüáµ‚ú® ‚Äì Here's My Unique Itinerary for Tokyo & Kyoto!,"Before delving into the details of my trip, I'd like to share some background about my travel preferences:

**Anxiety & Planning**: After browsing numerous itineraries here, I realized that I needed something more tailored to my needs. Travel tends to heighten my anxiety, so I prioritized relaxation and self-care. This itinerary was constructed to indulge in Japan's beauty, with ample breaks and moments of solitude. This paid dividends, as many people on the tours mentioned being completely exhausted running all over the city. We did not want to come home needing a vacay from vacay.

**Accommodations**: I acknowledge that the accommodations I've chosen might not be accessible to everyone. However, booking in advance enabled huge savings and without these savings, I would not have chosen these accommodations. A six-months-in-advance reservation at **Hoshinoya Tokyo** afforded me a 50% discount. For **Hotel The Mitsui Kyoto**, I used points + cash which cut the nightly price in half. Because I have Marriott Gold status (through Amex), we got a room upgrade (I had booked the cheapest room).-

**Travel Preparations:** My planning started six months prior to the trip. I like planning and getting good deals!!! **Jet lag was also a primary concern.** My jet lag kryptonite included the *Time Shifter app, Luminette light therapy glasses, and a 16-hour fast*. This fast was timed to end on the plane, allowing our first meal to align with Tokyo time, aiding in our adjustment. I HAD NO JET LAG!!!!!! (This is a miracle. I always have it and always get sick. I had neither on this trip).

**Airlines:** We flew via **Japan Air**, initially booking Premium Economy (ensure it's directly operated by Japan Air). However, a few days before the flight I was able to bid to upgrade to Business Class which I did (I booked $15 above the lowest possible bid, $605 for each ticket). We won the upgrade. Our tickets, including the bid, were about $1,700 each. I booked our original PE tickets six months in advance for $1,100. They went up about $700 by the time we approached the trip. I recommend bidding for an upgrade rather than buying outright, we got business class for what other folks payed for PE. Buying Business Class outright was $20k (one way!!) before the trip so the bidding process was a HUGE discount.-

**Scheduling Philosophy:** My daily schedule contained ONE planned activity per day. (YES I know this is sacrilege for this subreddit!) My vision was to truly experience Japan on my terms‚Äîrelishing its cuisine, partaking in leisurely strolls, and savoring unhurried moments in cafes. I understand the appeal of jam-packed schedules, but that's not me. I noticed many tourists cramming multiple activities into their day, often to the point of exhaustion. In contrast, my partner and I felt refreshed and invigorated. We know there was more to see but we hope to be able to come back one day and feel as though we saw plenty anyway.-

Now, let's dive into the trip itself:

**\*Tokyo - 5 days\***

**Accommodations**:

**Day 1** \- Arrive **Hoshinoya Tokyo** ([https://www.hoshinoya.com/tokyo/en/](https://www.hoshinoya.com/tokyo/en/)). This was our anniversary stay. We are a gay female couple and were concerned about homophobia but experienced none. We booked this oasis six months in advance, which enabled a 50% discount. This tranquil haven became our sanctuary amidst Tokyo's bustling streets.

A few highlights:

* Daily retreats to the \*17th-floor onsen\* ‚Äî an unexpected quiet in the heart of downtown Tokyo.
* Exceptional service and a delicious traditional Japanese breakfast.
* The bathroom, filled with premium facial products.
* An exquisite flower arrangement for our fourth anniversary.
* Incredible service.
* Kimonos and PJs in room.

**Day 2 (Tuesday):** Started the day with a serene walk around the **Imperial Palace**, then headed to **Shimokitazawa**. I walked the meandering roads with no plans and no timetable. Engaged in some great people-watching and nabbed a few thrifted items. The donuts from *Mister Donut* were a treat.

**Day 3**: This was my 40th birthday. We started at **Glitch Coffee** ([https://glitchcoffee.com/](https://glitchcoffee.com/)) (a bit pricey but worth it!). After, we went to Ginza and randomly witnessed the morning opening at **Mitsukoshi** (a department store)‚Äîthe atmosphere was electric. Many people had lined up to be the first ones in and we quickly learned why! The day peaked with an **Izakaya Food Tour** ([https://abnb.me/0nuDywzsbDb](https://abnb.me/0nuDywzsbDb)) in **Shinjuku**. We toured four izakayas, navigated the red-light district, and snapped memorable photos. Our tour guide Yuki was incredible. The food was mind-blowing.

**Day 4:** Breakfast at **Bill‚Äôs** for their famed ricotta pancakes. Took a refreshing break at our hotel, followed by a rejuvenating headspa treatment at **Wayanpuri** in Ginza. We don‚Äôt have headspas in the States. I‚Äôm into ASMR and a headspa treatment was kinda what I built my trip around lol **(YouTube: ASMR Twix).**

Later, we caught a **sumo tournament** (book in advance, only three a year!) at the sumo arena. Insane!!!! So violent, they literally tried to take each other's heads off. We are now sumo fans for sure. Easy to learn the rules and EXCITING!! The evening wrapped with sushi at **Sushi Mizukami** ([http://sushi--mizukami.jp/en/](http://sushi--mizukami.jp/en/)), a 9-seat Michelin Star sushi spot near Imperial Palace. You can easily book through MyConcierge ([https://myconciergejapan.com/](https://myconciergejapan.com/)).

**Day 5**: Travel day to **Kyoto** aboard the Shinkansen. A hiccup at Tokyo station with our **SmartEX** tickets, but we eventually sorted it out.

**\*Kyoto - 4 days\***

**Day 1:** Arrive **Hotel The Mitsui** The property's grounds and garden left us in awe ‚Äî both the service and the ambiance managed to surpass Hoshinoya.

Highlights:

* A breathtaking onsen, albeit a tad cooler than Hoshinoya's.
* Another delectable traditional Japanese breakfast.
* Service, service, SERVICE!!! They even went to the train station to get our train tickets! üò≥

Evening at the historic **Yoshikawa Inn** ([http://www.kyoto-yoshikawa.co.jp/sp/en/](http://www.kyoto-yoshikawa.co.jp/sp/en/)) ‚Äî their tempura is a must-try. They have actual inconspicuously placed (caged) **crickets** in all the rooms to add to the old-timey ambiance. It was like stepping into 1800s Kyoto.

**Day 2 (Saturday)**: A serene private tea ceremony at **Camellia Garden** ([https://www.tripadvisor.com/AttractionProductReview-g298564-d19763579-Stunning_Private_Tea_Ceremony_Camellia_Garden_Teahouse-Kyoto_Kyoto_Prefecture_Kink.html)) followed by a free-roaming of local streets around our hotel which led to an exploration of coffee shops, ceramics, and art stores. Returned with local coffee and art by a local artist.

**Day 3 (Sunday)**: Embarked on the **Fushimi Inari Hidden Hike** ([https://abnb.me/9rtFyfvsbDb](https://abnb.me/9rtFyfvsbDb)). This hike was super woodsy and challenging! I do not recommend it unless you love nature and hiking! After, we shopped our hearts out at **Nishiki Market,** where we had Kobe beef and chicken skewers, soy milk donuts, and Subi soft serve -yuzu and honey flavor; then ended with some coin laundry and sleep.

**Day 4 (Monday):** Depart for Seoul!

**Additional Insights:** **A Few Common Concerns Addressed**

**Medication**: Like many, we were quite anxious about the medication stories shared here. Here's our experience: I did not bring meds in original bottles but opted for a pill organizer and took photos of my medication bottles as a precaution. I brought 2 weeks' worth. I brought a few (unauthorized) Xanax for the flight. (Thanks mom!) Throughout customs, nobody checked or questioned our medications. No one around us removed anything from their luggage. To be honest, we were off the flight and into our taxi within 10 minutes. Customs was very fast and much more efficient than many places I‚Äôve visited.

**Tattoos**: Allegedly, tattoos are still a bit taboo, but it seems times are changing.- I have a full sleeve, and while moving around Tokyo, not a single odd stare.- At **Hoshinoya Tokyo,** they preferred we use the private onsen option since it's traditional and fully nude. **Hotel The Mitsui,** on the other hand, has a co-ed onsen where swimsuits are mandatory, and tattoos are not an issue.

**Dress Code:** With the blazing 100¬∞F temperature, I saw a lot of people, who I assumed to be locals, with exposed shoulders and wearing quite short shorts.

**Language**: Communicating exclusively in English wasn't a problem in either Tokyo or Kyoto.

**Money**: Brought along ¬•44,300 ($300 USD) for the week (for two of us) and used the last of it at the laundromat the night before leaving Japan. **Everywhere accepted credit cards.**

**Transit**: Uber was our primary ride, but I did venture on the train once. I highly recommend the Suica card, preloaded via Amex.

**Phone**: I have Verizon in the US. I bought a Ubigi eSim (Airalo was sold out??) and it worked well. I accidentally activated it too soon so had to send a message to customer service and they extended the expiration date to my return home date.

**TL/DR** You don‚Äôt have to do the itineraries you see here or by travel influencers online. Make Japan whatever you want it to be, for me that was rest and relaxation! Splurge on accommodations, where possible. Book everything at least 6 months in advance for discounts. Book only one thing per day; let the rest just evolve naturally. No one can see everything and trying to do so is an impediment to actually experiencing Japan.

Safe travels!

And don't leave without trying the **Famichiki** at Family Mart!

Edit: Formatting.",https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/16ls1jx/introverts_dream_a_stressfree_luxurious_japan/,Thank you for formatting that beautifully.,"I think more people should consider not jam-packing their schedules. I took a similar approach and only scheduled 2-3 main activities per day. Even that was a bit exhausting. But I love that there are others here who appreciate a less stressful travelling experience. I also agree that almost everywhere we went, English was completely fine - it‚Äôs surprisingly common that there‚Äôs someone who can speak English, or that there‚Äôs English signage or menus.","We stayed at Hoshinoya Tokyo about 2 weeks ago and had an amazing stay! The service was top notch, the building was pristine, the kimonos and PJs were very nice, and the rooftop onsen was like something out of a movie. Super easy to get around with the underground access to the subway and tunnel to Tokyo Station. And the scrambled eggs in the western breakfast are *chefs kiss*. Would absolutely recommend staying there. 

We also booked way in advance (about 9mo out) and got a heavy % off for booking consecutive nights.","OP I am also team only-one-activity-per-day because I found that‚Äôs all I truly had time for when factoring in commute and time for anything spontaneous or leisurely. And my teen not getting out of the hotel before 11am. 

Can you explain more about the fast? I‚Äôm curious. I‚Äôve often been so jet lagged it‚Äôs taken me 6 days to fully adjust!",
c453s1,List of Japan-exclusive items,"Hi all, this subreddit has been very useful for new and seasoned tourists alike. I have been to Japan twice and would be going back there again this year. As I was researching on things to buy for my upcoming trip, I decided why not compile a shopping list and post it on /r/JapanTravel? 

Feel free to add to the comments section below and I'll add them to the list accordingly. Hope that you find this useful!

----
**Food**

1. Tea: Apart from Matcha, Japan is also known for their Gyokuro (One of the highest grade of Japanese tea available and is characterised by its fine green color, rich aroma and mellow sweet flavor), and Genmaicha (a Japanese brown rice green tea consisting of green tea mixed with roasted popped brown rice).
2. KitKat: If you're visiting Japan for the first time, the number of flavours for KitKat can be overwhelming. They range from the regular matcha KitKat to the more interesting Sake and even Wasabi flavours!
3. Tokyo Banana: This isn't a fruit, but a type of fluffy cake filled with banana custard cream. A must-buy when you're visiting Japan.
4. Shiroi Koibito: Shiroi Koibito is a European-style cookie with chocolate sandwiched in between. Another famous item for gift giving.
5. Baumkuchen: a German speciality that has been japanified. It's a sort of a cake. 
6. Furikake: Japanese rice seasoning to make rice taste so much better

**Clothing**

1. Jeans: Japanese denim jeans are famous for their quality. Their unique fabrics which are designed by the companies themselves. Check out [/r/rawdenim](https://www.reddit.com/r/rawdenim/) for more information. Some famous brands are Japan blue, Samurai jeans, Oni, Pure blue, Iron Heart.

2. Sneakers: Japan is famous for its wide variety of sneakers. A good pair of sneakers can be practical and also may have designs not available back in your home country. The famous brands are Adidas, Nike, Onitsuka Tigers.

---
**Others**

1. Knives: Japanese knives are famous for being incredibly strong and sharp. Of course, with high quality comes a higher price. Why not consider adding a Japanese knife to your kitchen? Some examples are Shun, Masamoto 
2. Cosmetics: This requires no introduction. There's just too many to choose from. Masks, cleansers, toners are also way cheaper in Japan than back home. I personally use brands from Hada Labo and DHC.
3. Camera equipment: Photography is an expensive hobby. However, shutterbugs can rejoice as in Japan it's generally cheaper (of course depending on the lens you buy). If you're on a tight budget, you may even consider getting a second hand camera (or lens) in Map Camera. They are known for their quality control and are very transparent about the conditions of the item (even to the most miniscule issue about the product).
4. Glasses: From as low as $50 USD, get a brand new pair of spectacles or sunglasses made in under an hour. Select from a list of trendy frames along with lenses that cater to a variety of needs (Astigmatism, PC lens, thin lens with high refractive index) and you're ready to go. These glasses can be found mainly from shops like Zoff and Jins.
5. Watches: Adding to the list of must buys in Japan, watches (like Seiko) are a must have when you visit. Many are made only in the Japanese Market. 
6. Umbrellas: Grab a quality made in Japan umbrella when you're visiting. There's umbrellas that form a sakura pattern when it rains! 
7. Limited editions CDs: many artists have CDs only available in the country and unreleased to the rest of the world. 
8. Washlets: definitely do check them out if you've ever tried a Japanese toilet. 
9. Japanese stationery: for artists and tourists alike, Japan has no lack of variety of stationery and arts stuff.",https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/c453s1/list_of_japanexclusive_items/,Watches- especially Seiko. Many are made for the Japanese market only.,"I would throw in umbrellas (there is this dept store in tokyo skytree where I bought a 600 yen umbrella that has lasted me for years in nyc weather) and Hokkaido exclusive snacks (hori corn chocolate, hori rice crackers) and their butter milk cookies (Kinotoya)...Not exclusive to Hokkaido, but black thunder chocolate bars","Muji - These are starting to expand around the world, but they are phenomenal in Japan with a massive array of goods and even foods. The new one at Ginza even has a hotel! It has everything plain, simple, and sophisticated that you didn't realize you needed. It's also quite affordable and a nice place for small souvenirs, especially edible ones. 

Yuzukosh≈ç (ÊüöÂ≠êËÉ°Ê§í) - a special condiment with the yuzu fruit that is citrusy and unique to Japan. 

Shichi-mi t≈çgarashi - a spice blend that is a Japanese staple. 

Baumkuchen - a German specialiity that has been Japan-ified. There is a huge array of flavors and available from smaller pastry shops as well as at Muji

Sakura - all of the cherry blossom flavored goods are worth a try if you like a light cherry taste. 

Kappabashi kitchen goods - this is a great place to find stainless steel and ceramic goods that are made in Japan. 

Limited edition CDs / music - many artists have CDs that are only available in Japan with unreleased elsewhere songs or even full albums, like one of my favorites, Avicii.","I‚Äôd like to add some of my suggestions and thank you for opening a thread for this! I‚Äôm returning to Japan for a third time and I really love buying unique Japanese things, or products that are much cheaper in Japan. I hope to find more things to buy lol

Here are my recommendations:

Food
1. Calbee Chips (specifically potato sticks/ „Åò„ÇÉ„Åå„Çä)
They are really exceptionally crispy and unlike any other chip I‚Äôve had, have never been able to locate them outside of Japan either!
2. Langue du Chat Matcha biscuits
These are thin, crispy wafer like biscuits that are really popular 
3. Pocky
Similar to kit kat, pocky flavours are so diverse and amazing. My favourite is the adult pocky with the extra crispy stick, coated with nuts and chocolate. I recently tried Cherry mega pocky from Sapporo and it was so good!

Clothing
1. Ichizawa Shinzaburo Canvas Bags[ in Kyoto](https://www.ichizawa.co.jp/en/about/) 
These bags are not sold anywhere else except their flagship store in Kyoto. They are quite pricey but excellent quality, minimal bags with many styles. They have tax exemption too over a certain amount. 
2. For women I recommend the brand PUNYUS which has a shop in Shibuya109. They are very Japan/quirky style clothing which goes from size s- 2xl. As a foreigner I can barely fit most one size Japanese fashion so I love this brand for the style and sizes. 


That‚Äôs all I can think of right now ü§£",In regards to the glasses... Do I just bring my US prescription and they will be able to make it on the spot?
yyi58b,When in Rome - an irritated rant,"My partner and I (Australian) have been here for almost a week of our three week stint now, and I have to say for the most part, other (obvious) tourists from most countries have been pretty good in respect to wearing a mask in indoor settings, abiding by the general Japanese mindset of being considerate and respectful of others around them etc.

But for those of you I've noticed on my travels being maskless or with it tucked firmly under your chin, why? The Japanese (especially older generations) were so hesitant to get tourism back to Japan after the pandemic and you are shining examples of why the older Japanese generally don't like western tourists!! Just wear the fucking mask and shut the fuck up! If you don't want to wear it, then don't come here until things ease up. The signs are literally everywhere at shops, trains, whatever. 

The kicker was today my partner and I saw three Aussie tourists, young guys in Kyoto at a tourist destination and one of them was getting irritated because the facility staff were super hesitant to let him in without a mask. Like for fucks sakes mate, how hard can it be to wear it for the hour it took to walk through the castle?

Please, stop giving the Japanese reasons to dislike tourists and just abide by their requirements while you're here. Masks are like 350 yen for a 4 pack.",https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/yyi58b/when_in_rome_an_irritated_rant/,"I'm locking it as this type of posts have a tendency to lead to comments, which are untrue, unhelpful or misleading (and I'm sorry OP - your intentions were fine).

**If you are coming to Japan, know that majority of Japanese still wear masks and while there is no mask mandate - it's still recommended to wear masks on public transport and whenever talking or unable to keep the distance.** Please also note that Japanese business are free to refuse service to anyone, who does not accept their rules including wearing masks.","I'm an Australian, and it's always the fucking Australians when it comes to dickhead tourists in Japan. Precovid, bogans quickly started to realise how cheap and accessible Japan is to us and have started treating it like a more upscale version of Bali.","I‚Äôll say, when I was in other parts of Japan on my trip these last two weeks (Tokyo, Nagasaki, Hakone, Takayama, etc), most foreigners I saw were wearing masks. But in Kyoto maybe only 1/3 of them were. I would get pissed every time I saw this. Guys, the hell, just wear the damn mask. These people are ruining it for the rest of us and making us look bad.","I just got back from my 2 week trip and I agree with everything you said. Every time I saw a foreigner not wearing a mask I kinda just shook my head. It literally is baffling. We've been waiting YEARS to come back to Japan how hard is it to just follow how the rest of the society is behaving and play along? 

Mind you, I did see some Japanese not wearing masks and thats on them. Even a friend of mine (Japanese) didn't wear one when we went out, but being the foreigner myself I still wore mine just out of respect for those around me.",[deleted]

bslcd0,Thank you to the amazing gentleman who saved our trip,"My wife and I had a great experience with one of the locals in Osaka and just wanted to share it here. We had landed at the airport around 10pm and followed the hotel instructions to use the local subway. There was a connection between two lines to get to our hotel and in the middle we had discovered that the subway closed by the time we reached Tengachaya station. We had no access to internet since the sim stores at the airport were closed by the time we landed. Tried to take a taxi but the language barrier was too much. Taxi driver ended up giving up since we only had the hotel name and the address we had was in English. Underandably, we had to pay the starting fee and get out of the taxi. At this point we were panicking and I wanted us to just walk the 1.5 hours relying hopefully on free WiFi along the way. 

There was a young man at the station waiting for his friends so we decided to ask him for help. He spoke very little English except a few words and I spoke zero Japanese. He was so patient with us all the way through. Ended up asking for the phone number to the hotel so he could google where it was. Got us a taxi and explained to the driver how to get there. He was just such an awesome human being. It was not easy at all trying to figure out how to help us and he could have easily just walked away. Definitely saved two dumb tourists that day.

Thanks you saint of a man! We're really enjoying your city right now and you're really representing it very well.",https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/bslcd0/thank_you_to_the_amazing_gentleman_who_saved_our/,"FYI.. that first taxi driver probably could have gotten you to the hotel with just the phone number.  All Japanese Navigation systems can find locations by phone number.  And you got screwed on the first taxi fee.. they usually don't start the meter until they know where they're going, bad luck on that one.","I think is a good lesson we can take both on being good hosts in our own cities (I always offer to take people's pictures for them and help with directions if they look lost) and to be better prepared when you arrive in a new place (name, address, phone numbers are a must).",I never had to ask for help because of google translate I basically spoke the language very poorly. Lol. But the few times we where somewhat lost everyone was incredibly helpful even though they weren‚Äôt getting anything out of it. Very shocking coming from Miami where no one wants to help you.,I got back from Japan 2 days ago. I figured out how to read the signs and platform numbers pretty quickly. I liked getting to my stations early (30min) so I could check things out. I had so many people come up and ask if I needed help. Even tho they could not speak English they still wanted to help. It was amazing that people would just do that!,Booking.com has basically been my saviour. As it works offline and has a button to show addresses in local language.
14sum76,"How to access live music in Japan, and why it should be on everyone's travel itinerary","Japan's cities have some of the most exciting live music scenes on Earth. You should check them out while you're here!

Tokyo's music hubs of Shimokitazawa and Koenji, as well as Shinjuku and Shibuya, have probably the highest density of music venues of anywhere on the planet. Every single night, you can find unbelievably high-quality acts of every genre playing their hearts out in the small underground venues known as 'livehouses', with thoughtfully-crafted shows just waiting to blow you away.

Major concerts that utilise the big Japanese ticket sites are infamously difficult for tourists to access, and unless the organiser specifically creates a tourist-friendly ticket page, they are essentially off-limits. But the good news is that indie shows - the real, raw, living, exciting events that define Japan's subculture - are extremely accessible once you know where to look, and tick about every box of things you want from a travel itinerary item:

‚úÖ Fun, memorable, truly unique experience

‚úÖ You can meet people, or use an event as a meetup spot

‚úÖ Off the beaten track

‚úÖ No need to leave downtown Tokyo

‚úÖ Band merch makes great souvenirs

‚úÖ Not expensive (most shows are ¬•3000-ish)

‚úÖ You will be supporting independent artists

Also if you watched the anime *Bocchi The Rock!*, this is that, but real.

The rough-and-ready nature of the scene means it has a few quirks and things to know in order to access, but once you're clued up, you'll be surprised at how easy and casual it is to find your way into a truly excellent show.

# Finding Event Information

There is no single aggregator of livehouse shows, as every venue hosts their own schedule separately. The only way to find *everything* is to go on Google Maps, search 'livehouse', and click through each venue to check their calendars.

However, there are a few attempts to collect gig information in one place, in Tokyo at least:

* [Gigs in Tokyo](https://www.instagram.com/gigsintokyo/) ^(my page, shared here with mod permission)
* [Tokyo Gig Guide](https://www.tokyogigguide.com/en/)

* [Sonbei](https://sonbei.jp/en)
* [Tokyo Dross](http://tokyodross.blogspot.com/)
* [japangigs](https://www.instagram.com/japangigs/)
* [Kaala Music](https://kaalamusic.substack.com/) (for hardcore/metal, paid)

If you're totally lost, just head to [Shimokitazawa BASEMENT BAR](https://toos.co.jp/basementbar/), [THREE](https://www.toos.co.jp/3/), [LIVE HAUS](https://livehaus.jp/), [Chikamichi](https://chikamichi-otemae.com/chikamichi/), or [Shibuya TOKIO TOKYO](https://tokio.world/schedule) in Tokyo, [Socore Factory](https://socorefactory.com/), [Pangea](https://livepangea.com/), or [Namba Bears](https://namba-bears.main.jp/) (""the most punk venue in Japan"") in Osaka, [nano](https://livehouse-nano.com/) and [takutaku](http://www.geisya.or.jp/~takutaku/) in Kyoto, [K.D Japon](https://kdjapon.jimdofree.com/) in Nagoya, or [Utero](http://utero.jp/) in Fukuoka. The organisers here have an unmatched sense when it comes to uncovering the best up-and-coming acts, and every show is a hit.

# Getting Tickets

At the majority of indie shows, you reserve a ticket in advance by sending an email or DM to an artist or organiser. In it, you state your name and how many tickets you want. Many events will also ask that you specify which featured act you are most interested in seeing.

Working out where to send your email/DM can be tricky sometimes when the information is only in Japanese (On Gigs in Tokyo, we solved this with [a bilingual ticket form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdn4mpOJitYvyhpnfN42RBXFDmSINSV0pz4eqh6I-8KhvXPPg/viewform)), but the contact info will always be listed somewhere on the event page or associated social media post(s). If you really can't find it, try contacting one of the featured artists and they will usually be happy to take your reservation or point you in the right direction - there's nothing a band loves more than someone who wants to come to their show.

Ticket reservation isn't essential, as you can buy on the door and indie shows rarely sell out, but doing is always worth doing as it guarantees you entry and usually knocks ¬•500 off the ticket price. The deadline for ticket reservations is typically midnight the day before the show, but depending on the organiser, they may still be accepted up to a few hours beforehand.

Once your email/DM is sent, you are good to go. You don't pay anything up front.

# Getting Into The Venue

When you arrive, the person at the desk will ask your name and, if applicable, which band you're most interested in seeing. Almost all venues only take cash at the front desk, so have the amount ready.

Invariably, you will also be asked to buy a drink ticket (¬•500-700 depending on the venue) that you can exchange at the bar inside. This is mandatory, and standard practice at venues across Japan.

With that done, you're in! Re-entry policy varies by venue: some will allow re-entry, some will not, and some will ask that you buy a new drink ticket each time.

# Gig Etiquette

Japanese audiences are likely much more subdued than where you're from. Many people here treat live music spaces almost like art galleries: as places to appreciate the art of live performance, even when that performance is an energetic rock show.

However, that doesn't mean you have to stand still and stay quiet! Every artist I have spoken to says they love it when audience members dance, cheer, and sing along. So if you want to let loose, feel free to do so as long as you don't bump into anyone, and don't talk over the performance.

Filming at concerts is generally okay. Doing so was banned for a long time and those rules have only recently been loosened, so most Japanese audience members will still avoid pulling out their phone to film things. But except in cases where it is made explicitly clear that filming is not allowed through signs and/or announcements, filming is fine and indie artists almost always appreciate it when you share your video of them on social media (be sure to tag them!). Just don't watch the whole thing through your phone screen.

And that's it! With one more special travel memory, perhaps a few more friends, and maybe a new band T-shirt obtained, you will almost certainly be walking out of the show thinking about how you can find the next one. Japan's underground scene is waiting for you, and will always reward you for the time and attention you give it.

Does not even have to be major concerts. There is several bands I like that had shows but they all used Ticket Pia or e+, that require a phone number to create an account. I was lucky enough to have a friend who let me use his number so I could go see a show. I think some of the show I spotted where sold out, so trying to get tickets at the door is still a bit of a gamble (I think).

 But I went to a show from a band I saw playing in Yoyogi park and I think I just went and got my ticket at the door.","Thanks for the post. I'm saving it to see what's going on later this year.

8b7b5n,A word of advice for those travelling to Japan and wanting to book restaurants...,"I am a Japan travel specialist, working in the luxury, very high end category. This post is intended to offer some advice to those heading to Japan who want to eat out at the top/famous restaurants particularly but is (I hope) useful advice for all.

A lot of our clients come to us with long lists of restaurants they want us to book for them and ask for reservations to be made for each night. They do this fully intending to cancel some of them nearer the time but like to have the bookings in place. This is especially true of clients from the US.

This sort of approach leads to a lot of problems and I want to explain why.

In the US, it seems, it is perfectly normal and acceptable to make restaurant reservations and then cancel. I don't know how the restaurant trade in the US feels about this but in Japan, it is not at all the way things are done and it definitely leads to bad feelings and closed doors. 

This year alone, we have been told by 3 separate restaurants that they will no longer accept reservations from foreign tourists because of so many cancellations. Many restaurants in Japan are small and the chef will plan and prepare based on the number of reservations he has each night. If clients cancel, this either means wasted food or empty seats, neither of which are good for them.

Of course everyone understands that sometimes reservations have to be cancelled when there's an unavoidable reason but we see so many clients who ask us to book and then cancel because they no longer feel like going or another restaurant was available. This approach may well be fine back home but in Japan, it is considered very poor manners and bewilders the owners/chefs because they cannot understand why foreigners behave like this.

Of course I know that food and eating out is a major reason for many people going to Japan and that's great. All I want visitors to understand is that there is a *very* different culture and perspective in regard to reservations so if you book a table, while thinking at the back of your mind that you may well cancel later if something better comes up or if you just don't feel like it on the day, you are not only being extremely rude, you are potentially ruining the chances of any other foreign visitor going to that restaurant at a later date.

TLDR: Please don't try to prebook meals for every night of your trip to Japan and please don't make reservations unless you definitely want to eat at that restaurant because cancellations are bad for everyone.

*PS: Please don't PM me asking about booking restaurants for you!*

",https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/8b7b5n/a_word_of_advice_for_those_travelling_to_japan/,I've seen people on here saying how they have booked a back up hotel/air bnb/ restaurant and I always think the same. It's rude and can damage a business why people think it's acceptable or recommend it is beyond me!,"Great post. Honestly speaking didn't realise people did this as you described. It should be obvious (but obviously isn't) that it's selfish and unacceptable behaviour.

We book restaurants for our clients and haven't had this problem yet. Most of our clients are from Singapore so wonder if it's a US cultural thing. To give the benefit of the doubt perhaps it's a cultural misunderstanding?","I wonder if this is exacerbated by the fact that many potential highlights on a trip to popular destinations in Japan require so much planning/booking ahead of time and is a way for some to hedge their bets. I've been to a number of distilleries/winers/breweries and museums around the world and have never come across a tour booked solid months in advance (Yamazaki) or a museum selling out months in advance (Ghibli). So the mentality (sadly) becomes, BOOK EVERYTHING.","Most fancier restaurants in America, Michelin restaurants, etc. require a credit card and would charge a big cancellation or no-show fee. (Price of the meal). 

I also think many American tourists don't do luxurious dining at all in the US, but when they come to Japan they want to try it. At casual chain restaurants here like TGI Fridays, Chilis, etc. a no-show is not a big deal.





",Disappointed but not surprised that people do this.
yfob9b,Just returned from Japan: some thoughts,"Returned today from two weeks in Tokyo, Karuizawa and Kyoto. Note: I still love Japan after my third visit. It was not depressing and there's plenty of life but...

**Observations:**

Masks are pretty much everyone, everywhere, all the time, indoor and out.(This may or may not not prove a big irritation to you.) 

Likewise sanitiser, temperature checks and requests to not engage in conversation. (Yep - on signs and over PA announcements.)

Tip: Buy some local lightweight masks at a Lawsons or pharmacy with non-elastic straps for the sake of your ears. They come in packs of 30 and it'll be the best purchase you make all trip.

Tourist numbers are still very, very low compared to usual. We were regularly alone or nearly alone in cocktail bars etc which was a tad dull but of course often we enjoyed the lack of crowds.

That said - the streets and subways of Tokyo will always be full of life and people. The population is 125 million or so!

Flights from Australia there and back were 40% and 60% full. Shinkasen and Narita Express were not busy at all (still have to reserve a seat though for NEX though regardless. No reservation - no access - no flight.)

As a result of zero tourists for two years the Narita Express and Limousine Bus are at much reduced service levels. Narita Express was one-per-hour yesterday afternoon (instead of three per hour) and I'm sure that will catch some folk out. Don't expect them to respond to queries or have a good website.

Narita Airport was 75% closed in terms of shops and restaurants and some opened at 4pm to coincide with flights.

In general many restaurants, bars etc are out of business, closing early, opening late, reducing hours etc due to lack of staff and / or clients. Double check before you go anywhere. They are only just getting back into gear for international or local tourism.

Other things - hotel bars, laundries, lounges - may be closed or reduced as part of Covid precautions. They are REALLY Covid-wary which often slows and stresses service in cafes etc.

Two of our hotels insisted on plastic gloves at the breakfast buffet which did not create a great morning vibe. They also gave us a little special envelope in which to rest our masks as we ate. Eco madness.

Staff have been laid off and businesses are rehiring and as a result frontline staff were often less experienced than on our previous visits. The chap at the JR stand at Narita Airport had never been asked to issue a JR Pass before! It took a LONG time and a lot of help from his supervisor. I hope they speed up before the hoards descend.

Consider not getting your JR Pass upon arrival at Narita, though of course the Narita Express is included in your pass.

Oh - download and complete the MySOS app but keep in mind that the blue screen isn't enough to speed up your immigration process. You'll also need to use the airport wifi or a mobile service to allow them to do something with your app. This wasn't well explained when we arrived on the third day of the re-opening. It might be better now.

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/JapanTravel) if you have any questions or concerns.*","Been in Japan since early October (pre open borders) and have to disagree with a lot of what you wrote.

Agree: masks, plastic gloves at hotels, Covid precautions/procedures etc 

Disagree: everything is now really busy. I‚Äôve been on about 4-5 shinakansens, the recent ones almost all full. There were only a handful of individual seats free on the Tokyo - Osaka I took today for example . Lunch and dinner time restaurants are packed with lines in at least Tokyo and Hiroshima and popular tourist places. And there are foreign tourists everywhere now, my completely anecdotal perception is that it feels like pre-Covid. Hospitality business owners I‚Äôve spoken to are stating it‚Äôs been their busy week in 3 years - tsukiji was jam packed on Sunday. The tea ceremonies at hamarikyu park on Saturday had a line of about 70 people waiting to see if people cancelled and they could get in instead.","I just got to Tokyo a few days ago. Honestly, I‚Äôm seeing the same amount of tourists as pre-COVID, at least in Shibuya. There are temperature checks when walking into stores or restaurants, but it‚Äôs pretty simple, with you standing in front of a tablet to have your temperature checked or getting a reading from the palm of your hand. Takes like 2 seconds and it‚Äôs not mandatory in most places I‚Äôve been to. Mask wearing is common and expected, but doesn‚Äôt seem to be enforced. Things feel pretty normal in my opinion.","What kind of places have you been to... 

>In general many restaurants, bars etc are out of business, closing early, opening late, reducing hours etc due to lack of staff and / or clients. Double check before you go anywhere. They are only just getting back into gear for international or local tourism.

The few places that were catering mainly to international tourists have suffered or disappeared (hello Robot Restaurant), but for the rest (so the very, very vast majority of businesses), nah, it's pretty much completely normal and as busy as it ever was.","I just left a few days ago after like 18 days in Japan, and I was similarly surprised by just how dead NRT was. Most standalone stores closed, no one at security or immigration, and the open stores practically empty. The omiyage store that used to have lines out the door at all times even a decade ago had just me and one other group in it. The cosmetics store was empty, and the staff practically pounced on me. I‚Äôve been through NRT many many times, and this felt very weird.

The JAL Sakura Lounge was pretty full, though, especially as it got further into the evening. By the time I left, most chairs were filled and the food area was packed. They used to do a self-serve buffet, but they now take your order and plate up your food for you.

I will say that the Keisei Skyliner does not have a reduced schedule, though‚Äîor, at least, not an obvious one. It still seems to be running roughly every 20 minutes like before. So it‚Äôs another option to try instead of N‚ÄôEX if you‚Äôre going close to the Ueno area.

My flights were similarly low on load. My flight to Japan was before the full re-opening, and I think it was maybe 35% full. My return flight earlier this week was more full, but still not 100%. Maybe 75%?"
176h12q,Please help. My wife is having a medical emergency and don't know what to do,"I'm sorry I don't know what else to do, we have already gone to a hospital and paid ¬•50000 to only be discharged with no solution. We are at the beginning of a 2 week trip from the US and it has gone horribly wrong. We left Tokyo to head to Nagashima Spa Land yesterday. 

Soon after we got to Nagashima Spa Land my wife started having uncontrollable nausea due to what we thought was food poisoning. She vomited all day and could not and still cannot keep any liquid down. The hospital did scans and found a cyst in her right ovary which they suspect to be the cause. She has history with that ovary having had cysts and a torsion (where it twists out of position). They prescribed anti nausea pills but she can't even take them because she can't drink water. She also now has intense pain in her ovary in addition to nausea whenever she tries to drink any water. 

We are at Hotel Nagashima. The level of English here is not very high. The hotel was tremendously helpful in sending us to the hospital with an employee, but he barely spoke English so it was still difficult to communicate with the hospital staff. We are supposed to leave for Kyoto tomorrow evening but I don't know how we could make it there. We have no idea how the medical system here works. I have no phone number in order to call an ambulance. 

How can we get this taken care of? She likely will need surgery to remove the cyst and possibly the ovary but this is so serious I don't know if a hospital here would do it. And with communication being so difficult I just don't know what to do. We can't get her medical records here and even if we could I don't know if it would help since it's all in English.

* Fuji TV HQ Building
* Art Tower Mito",https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/d3ztau/overview_of_every_observation_deck_that_ive/,"Price would have been a good data to add!
Otherwise good list, personally I don't get excited that much by tall buildings anymore but when they are free or affordable I give them a try.

It's informative and well-formatted, and the photos are rad, thanks for such a quality post.","I think you‚Äôd also like Carrot Tower in Sangenjyaya as well. After the refurb you can see in all directions (just about) for free, with Shibuya skyscrapers to the east, possibility of seeing Fuji to the west, and low density residential all around meaning you can see for miles. Daytime and nighttime is nice. You‚Äôve also got a posh restaurant run by Hotel Okura now, Setagaya Public Theatre and a small art gallery downstairs, and you can access it by the super cute Setagaya line too."
16z47x0,What Is Otoshi? AKA Why did I get charged for this food I didn't order at a bar?,"_This is a short guide intended to address a common question/concern I see here on /r/JapanTravel._

## Introduction

Picture this. You arrived in Tokyo on your first trip to Japan. You get into the city from the airport, ditch your stuff at your accommodation in Shinjuku, and go out to find the biggest bowl of ramen you‚Äôve ever eaten for lunch. You have a great afternoon walking around Yoyogi Park and losing money to UFO catchers at an arcade.

You find dinner, and then you want some drinks afterward. You spent the whole plane ride looking forward to sitting down at an izakaya, ordering a whiskey/beer/sake/sour, and trying some chicken skewers. After the waiter takes your order, he returns a minute later with small bowls of edamame and pickled vegetables. _Hey, I didn‚Äôt order this,_ you think, but you don‚Äôt really want to rock the boat or ask questions, so you go along with it.

At the end of the meal, you and your travel companion see you were charged 400 yen each for the unordered appetizer. You‚Äôre tired, confused, and maybe a bit annoyed. What the heck even just happened?

What happened was that you were given and charged for otoshi („ÅäÈÄö„Åó). 

## What Is Otoshi?

_Otoshi_ („ÅäÈÄö„Åó), also sometimes known as _tsukidashi_ (Á™Å„ÅçÂá∫„Åó), is a small appetizer given once you place an order at a bar or other establishment serving alcohol. You can think of a it a bit like a cover charge, table charge, or service charge that comes with some food in return. It‚Äôs a custom primarily seen in bars, izakaya, and restaurants where the primary theme of the place leans more toward drinking than the food that comes with it. So you won‚Äôt generally see otoshi at family restaurants, fast food restaurants, food-focused restaurants, high-end eateries, and similar. 

Culturally and practically, otoshi serves a few purposes. To start, it very quickly gets some food out onto your table to go with your drinks, which can be great if you either didn‚Äôt order additional food or you ordered food that might take a while longer to prepare. It gives you something to immediately snack on along with your beer/wine/whiskey/etc. Additionally, it helps bring more revenue into the establishment, especially in a small bar where a group of people might linger at a table for quite a while, preventing quick turnover. 

These days, it‚Äôs a completely normal and accepted custom that you‚Äôll see frequently all over Japan. It likely won‚Äôt be listed on the menu, but the waiter might inform you of it when you sit down. You can also always ask about the cost of otoshi when you enter the bar/izakaya. **It‚Äôs important to keep in mind that otoshi is not a scam or a rip-off or a money grab or something that‚Äôs being charged because you‚Äôre a tourist. It‚Äôs simply the way most Japanese bars work.** 

## How Much Does Otoshi Cost?

Otoshi can vary in price, but it will generally be 300 - 800 yen per person. Higher-priced otoshi tends to come with either more/better food, or can be seen at establishments that are more popular or busier.

## What Food Will I Receive for Otoshi?

What you get as an otoshi varies a lot from establishment to establishment. At some places, the otoshi will be quite simple. It might be a bowl of nuts, edamame, rice crackers, miso soup, picked vegetables, tofu, or potato salad. Sometimes, it can be a more elaborate house specialty, such as a homemade dish, more complex soup, salad, or grilled fish. I once went to a robata restaurant where the otoshi was a nice little selection of seafood and rice cakes to cook on the grill! 

## Can I Refuse Otoshi?

You _can_ technically try to refuse otoshi, although you would need to do so the moment it is mentioned to you at your table or when the food is placed at the table. You cannot later dispute the otoshi charge at the end of the meal, even if you didn‚Äôt end up eating the otoshi. And if the staff tell you about otoshi before seating you, you are required to accept it once seated (as them telling you up front was your chance to back out of going to the restaurant).

_That said_, it would be exceptionally weird to refuse otoshi, and you‚Äôd likely encounter some pushback or confusion from the staff if you try. If you don‚Äôt want to receive and pay for otoshi, I recommend simply steering clear of the types of establishments that serve it.

## Can I Order More Otoshi?

Yes, you often can, although you will usually be charged an additional service charge for the additional food.

_For more information about otoshi, see [this article](https://thetokyotourist.com/table-charge-japan/) and [this article](https://gurunavi.com/en/japanfoodie/2017/04/otoshi-faq.html)._",https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/16z47x0/what_is_otoshi_aka_why_did_i_get_charged_for_this/,"Thank you.  I don't mind the concept of otoshi, and they are usually pretty tasty.",You should consider this as part of experiencing Japanese culture if you‚Äôre travelling there.,"Confused me the first time it happened there. Just shrugged it off. 

Good to know this is a thing.","I had to explain to some rather irate Kiwis and Brits what this thing was when I was in Wakayama a few months back.

While they were eating their otoshi they were trying to get the waitress to explain what this thing was and how much it cost, so after about 5 minutes of overhearing this I jumped in to ask the waitress if the dish was free or not, and eventually got the table to accept that it was going to be 300 yen/person (that took a while‚Ä¶).

I quickly scurried away because the izakaya menu was completely in Japanese and I didn‚Äôt want to have to translate that for them either. 

That all said, the best otoshi I‚Äôve ever received was a chicken tsukune from a yakitori place in Okachimachi. I‚Äôm not even a tsukune fan and that thing was amazing.","I was at Kyoto and overheard a tourist shouting at the hotel reception of her otoshi charge at the hotel restaurant, saying that in her home country, this will not happen. Duh lady, this is not your home country. 

 At that point of time I vaguely remembered the concept of otoshi that I read in some travel blog but couldn't recall the name, after that incident I googled to learn more about it. Nevertheless, being a global hotel brand, I felt the hotel probably could do better in adding the explanation of otoshi on the English menu like in a fun fact way."
12fb7pe,"Just back from 16 days honeymoon. Tokyo, Kyoto, Osaka, Hakone + pictures","I took/gained so much from this subreddit in my planning that I figured I would give back:

First-time trip for my wife (35F) and myself (34M). I booked our flights and hotels within a week of the announcement of reopening to general, non-guided tourism. Our planned stay was 3/19 - 4/5.

This was a bucket-list trip for us + 3yr delayed honeymoon. We didn't ball out but I wasn't too concerned about our spending for a celebratory occasion. Our focus was to eat well, have fun, and see[ ch](https://imgur.com/n59i1Oi)e[rry](https://imgur.com/IKJcUfU)[ bl](https://imgur.com/n59i1Oi)o[ss](https://imgur.com/9w6O6wO)o[ms](https://imgur.com/LHaQ2bM).

**Prep for Japan:**

* I had been lurking this subreddit for weeks, combing through comments for recommendations and travel tips. There was also a resurgence of content from Youtubers living/working in Japan that was helpful to know which businesses survived Covid, what tourist changes had occurred. 95% of my final itinerary was shaped by this sub.
* Reservation prioritization: Flights > Hotels > Specialty trains> USJ and major entertainment attractions> High-end meals (depending)> Shinkansen seats. I reserved everything online via SmartEx or used my Suica card to get around.
* Between Oct - Feb, over 90% of my lodging, nice meals, itinerary and POIs were reserved. I was trying not to over plan, but in hindsight I probably still did.
* Exchanged $1000USD back in October at JPY144:$1 rate. First time I timed something right.

Here is a custom Google Maps list of all of the various POIs and dining options we considered. https://goo.gl/maps/WHbBgikoUbPzrUzP9

**Accommodations & Transportation:**

* Tokyo: Shibuya, Sequence @ Miyashita Park: Great location, small rooms. This hotel had some poor reviews recently for the minimal staff experience, but i didn't experience any issues. Everyone I spoke with was able to communicate in English well enough.
* Kyoto: TSUGU Kyoto Sanjo near Nishiki Market: Great location, rooms were nice and reasonably sized. On-site laundry. Would recommend.
* Osaka: The Flag Shinsaibashi: Amazing location, fantastic hotel with modern accommodations, the rooms and restrooms were great. On-site laundry & coffee was great. I'd highly recommend.
* Hakone: Yama no chaya Asebi 100sq.m room with private open-air bath. This came recommended often on this sub for Hakone. I decided to splurge here for 2 nights. It was good, but I feel like you can get better for the price. More later.
* Tokyo pt2: Ginza, Aloft Ginza via Marriott points. 3 nights in the Larger King for \~150000 points. Great location, good amenities. Would recommend.
* All specialty trains and shinkansen tickets were booked 3+ weeks in advance via SmartEX app or online.

**TOKYO (4 days, Mar 20 - 24):**

* Initial flight from Austin to Houston suffered mechanical delay. We missed our ANA-operated flight to Haneda and United rebooked us the following morning 6AM from Austin>SFO>HND. Lost about 12 hours of vacation
* eSim via Ubigi on the day of arriving. Got the 30day/3GB for my wife, and the 10GB for me. We both used maybe 75% of it over 16 days.
* Picked up 2x Welcome Suicas directly in Haneda Terminal 3 prior to exiting for the Terminal 3 Station
* We wound up spending a lot of time in Ebisu,[ Naka](https://imgur.com/spTsH3i)meguro, and Daikanyama for one reason or another due to interesting meals or shopping.
* Things I skipped/missed: Meguro River Cruise (rain), Shibuya Sky (flight delay/wet weather)
* Things I loved: We had a chance to visit[ Toyosu Market](https://imgur.com/Cal1smX) on the[ wholesalers floor](https://imgur.com/u5dBZfJ) for a[ behind the scenes](https://imgur.com/u5dBZfJ) tour with chef Sato-san of Hakkoku and our Austin-based sushi chef who is training under him for several months. It was a treat to be able to walk with them as they did their daily morning shopping and vendor visits. Sometimes they[ aren't down](https://imgur.com/OTENmKL) with photos so you apologize and move on.

**KYOTO (4 days, Mar 24-28)**

* Reserved Shinkansen green car w/ reserved luggage storage 3+ weeks out for the discounted rate.
* We walked the[ Philosopher's Path](https://imgur.com/O6qoSDz) into[ Keage Incline](https://imgur.com/Skb5yZD) because of the peak cherry blossom bloom. Despite the[ hundreds](https://imgur.com/vOXBZf8) of tourists -- it was still a very idyllic scene.
* We booked the Fushimi Inari Locals‚Äô Hidden Hiking[ tour](https://imgur.com/d3bkTiI) that has been promoted by a few YouTubers and absolutely loved it. Probably one of the highlights of our trip. We saw[ maybe](https://imgur.com/PhkJ9EF) 50-100 people total in the first 2 hours of the 3HR hike up the back of the mountain. Only when exiting the front of Fushimi Inari did we catch up to the commonly-visited thousand gates area and sea of the general tourist population. I would highly recommend this hike if you want to enjoy a quieter path to visit Fushimi Inari. Be physically prepared for the uphill climb and have the right shoes for a modest hike.
* Things I skipped/missed: Arashiyama (weather + tired legs), Kiyomizu-dera night illumination (tired).
* Things I loved: Waking up and strolling around before 8-9AM before the world wakes up. Walking down[ \- Nishi-Kiyamachi-dori St](https://imgur.com/l2rZI6R) with[ blossoms](https://imgur.com/shXmlvC) everywhere, casual rooftop drinking @ ‚ÄòIn the Moon‚Äô, foot soak + much-needed massage at Mominoki House. Besides blossoms, there [were](https://imgur.com/9LLGjE3) [beautiful](https://imgur.com/C8pDJN6) [flowers](https://imgur.com/aWLgzTL) [everywhere](https://imgur.com/jfGY463).

**OSAKA (4 days, Mar 28-Apr 1)**

* Reserved the Kintetsu Limited Express sight-seeing[ train](https://imgur.com/JMuP5aG) AONIYOSHI from Kyoto > Nara for a day-trip, continuing on to Osaka by 5PM for our hotel check-in. We really enjoyed Nara as a calm and[ delightful](https://imgur.com/bx1uc5d) day trip. We walked past Nara park, towards the Mt Wakakusa base[ North Gate](https://imgur.com/uutOwKD) and scenic area filled with blossoms and deer.
* We then did a loop around Todai-ji before making our way to the crowded front entrance path and completing the loop back towards Kintetsu-Nara station to wrap our day trip. I purchased a damascus gyuto at Kikuichi Cutlery for myself and a santoku for my mom.
* Visited Team Labs Osaka at the Nagai Botanical Garden‚Ä¶ meh, but it was better than Naked @ Nijo-ji.
* Visited USJ on our last day, Friday 3/31 to what seems like a full crowd of 25-30K people. Bought the express pass on Klook that included Nintendo[ World](https://imgur.com/W9zacjc) timed admission, Harry Potter timed admission, Minions Ride, Spider-Man or Jurassic Park ride. I‚Äôve never really been big on theme parks and this was no different. 15-20 minute waits even with Express Pass for a 3-5 minute ride that sometimes gave us a bit of motion sickness was an experience that I won‚Äôt be rushing to do again. Spider-Man was pretty cool and the Forbidden Journey ride was immersively intense, but I was 2 minutes away from getting pretty nauseous. Good thing it was our last ride of the night.
* Things I skipped/missed: Osaka Castle Park (started to get blossomed out)
* Things I loved: The base of Mt. Wakakusa in Nara where there is a picturesque seated area with deers and park benches. Hotel the Flag Shinsaibashi was great and I would highly recommend it to anyone.

**HAKONE (2 days, April 1-3)**

* Reserved[ Shinkansen](https://imgur.com/WCT6ixq) from Shin-Osaka to Odawara 3+ weeks early for the green car with reduced rate. We sent all of our big luggage from Osaka back to Tokyo, only bringing our backpacks and a small duffel to Hakone.
* We stayed at Yama no chaya based on a lot of positive reviews on this subreddit. It was a charming place and our host was great -- but a 3PM check-in and 10AM checkout doesn‚Äôt leave a lot of time for activity given you automatically lose about 3-4Hrs solely dining in your room each day. The meals were very good, the private baths were good. However the valley views and sound of nearby traffic from the road left a little to be desired.
* Our host recommended traveling via the Hakone Tozan Railway instead of by bus that would crawl in traffic. The railway was more scenic for sure, but it still took about 30-40 minutes alone to move from Tonosawa to Gora station so it was probably a push, time-wise.
* I must have screwed up my ticket purchase from Gora up the ropeway to Sounzan because there was some ticket misunderstanding for myself and seemingly several other tourists as well resulting in some halting, items lost in translation with the station staff, and confused frustration.
* Things I skipped/missed: Hakone ropeway down to Togendai and visiting Lake Ashi and the Hakone shrine (not enough time to get back well before 6PM dinner)
* Things I loved: Self-serve[ green tea](https://imgur.com/Xblsv64) in the[ mornings](https://imgur.com/jSieS8a) and [A5](https://imgur.com/1XfHBYG) wagyu [hotpot](https://imgur.com/ZfAXTsp) on the second night of our stay at Yama no chaya

**GINZA (3 days, April 3-6)**

* Returned to Tokyo to stay in Ginza. Reserved seats on the observation deck car for the Odakyu Romancecar from Hakone-Yumoto to Shinjuku. Getting seats on the first row of the observation deck must be super difficult to secure, but seems well worth it.
* We enjoyed our plans for a baller omakase meal via a 25 course dinner with Chef Ryutaro @ Hakkoku. Despite meeting and touring Toyosu with Head Chef Sato-san a week prior, we were still first-time foreign visitors to Hakkoku and thus highly unlikely to get a seat with the big-boss himself. But, he did greet us to say hello. Among the highlights were sayori (needle fish), ankimo (monkfish liver), masu (sea trout), katsuo (bonito), and obviously the chutoro and otoro.
* We did most of our shopping in this final leg. I bought a pair of grails that I have been eyeing for years at[ Hender Scheme](https://imgur.com/lOII8po) in Ebisu. Reloaded on some basics at Uniqlo, did some thrifting in Kinji, oogled the merchandise at[ Worm](https://imgur.com/f0tDQ3S), scoffed at the prices at Dover Street Market Ginza.
* Had reservations for NAKED Cherry Blossoms night illumination at Shinjuku Gyoen. I didn‚Äôt do my research for this one because all the locals came early in full force, and came prepared for a full evening picnic in the park. In hindsight, we would have stopped by Lawsons to grab a bunch of food and drinks before entering the park.
* Things I missed/skipped: Ueno Park (blossomed out), Akihabara (didnt have luggage space to entertain what ifs)
* Things I loved: Finding the Kirin Lemon Tea, hot or cold. Walking around Shinjuku at night looking for [interesting](https://imgur.com/bQpVTML) [alleys](https://imgur.com/p5brXOi).

**FOOD/DINING:**

* Lawson‚Äôs tuna mayo + egg sandwiches have made me a member of team Lawson.
* I learned about how good Family Mart‚Äôs hot-and-ready chicken is.
* [A5 + uni](https://imgur.com/GFtQgH1) is just a bit too much richness. I'd rather be a A3 - A4 kind of guy.
* Ramen:
   * Even the ramen in the ANA Lounge was better than most i‚Äôve had in the states
   * Ate at Ippudo, didn‚Äôt get a chance to visit Ichiran but I was surprised to see a line for Ichiran no matter which city. To me, modern was better than classic.
   * Got the tsukemen at Wajoryomen Sugari in Kyoto. I didn‚Äôt want to be the asshole gaijin holding up the line trying to translate their Japanese-only POS, so we rushed the ordering process and hoped for the best. Got the tsukemen + raw egg add-on. I definitely screwed up by missing out on ordering the chashu slices.
   * Had the specialty fatty pork-rib ramen at Hanamaruken in Dotombori. A lot of the reviews said it was overly salty but I thought it was delicious. Salty? Not really. Fatty/greasy AF? Duh, you‚Äôre eating rendered[ pork rib.](https://imgur.com/xGHfrU6)
* Tokyo: Mark‚Äôs Tokyo - 3.15 on Tabelog which means average to good (for Japan). I saw this recommendation via a comment in a prior thread on /japantravel. Chef Mark is half Japanese/half Italian and was a former Finance bro turned late-blooming chef that trained in NYC. The meal was[ delicious](https://imgur.com/qmn9v8Z) and the atmosphere was charming. As someone who loves to cook, it was great to sit at a little 6-7 seat counter and watch him work a few feet away. And, it was a great opportunity to bounce my itinerary with a local in English at the beginning of my trip and get some future recommendations. He highly recommended trying Hirokazuya in Osaka, a hole in the wall okonomiyaki place and ordering the Buta Negiyaki.
* Tokyo: Yoroniku Ebisu - a 4.3+ on Tabelog which is usually means to expect great and I booked this via tablecheck. This was one of the BEST meals I had in Japan. The[ silky beef](https://imgur.com/BjmIXt0) will be a memory i keep forever and the[ zabuton + truffle sukiyaki](https://imgur.com/XCnFfHT)[ dip](https://imgur.com/LZPvaCN) shaved fresh at the table was simply umami overload. I don‚Äôt often pay for fresh table-side truffle in the states because it is a rip-off but our host and griller simply went to town on a whole truffle between the two of us. I gasped when she didn‚Äôt stop shaving the half piece she started with and proceeded to begin shaving the next one.
* Tokyo: Hakkoku Ginza - 3.9+ on tabelog which is very close to great. I booked this via Omakase(dot)in. My buddy is an Austin sushi chef who is training under chef Hiro-san. I considered booking at other places rated slightly higher (Arai, Ryujiro) at his recommendation -- but ultimately I thought it would be more interesting to eat where he was training so that we had the chance to see him and discuss/reminisce about a menu familiar for all of us. The experience was great, we sat at a counter full of foreign tourists (couple from melbourne, couple from shanghai) and the chef[ Ryutaro-san](https://imgur.com/tHTZxjt) did his best to make conversation. He was able to converse about the dishes well enough and he and I got along about golf.[ 25](https://imgur.com/rVTWsiD) courses was plenty of food but I came prepared, my wife was challenged at around course 21.
* Osaka: Yakitori Ichimatsu - 3.8+ on tabelog which is very good. I booked on Omakase(dot)in. The chef is an absolute pro in working with chicken. We got so full that we had to pass on some of the final rice or noodles. I don‚Äôt understand how some of these Japanese couples next to us were pounding down the same amount of meat and even more drinks. What champs.
* Tokyo: Tonkatsu Aoki Ginza - 3.75+ on tabelog which is very good. This came recommended from Chef Hiro-san for Tonkatsu in Ginza. We got both the mega[ fatty](https://imgur.com/qhmHZ1w)[ pork sirlion](https://imgur.com/vcCh2Ox) and the more modest pork filet. It looks like a lot of food at 300g + rice, cabbage, soup, but we both managed to finish our meals. It was worth a 30 minute wait.
* Kyoto: Hafuu Honten Main Store - 3.6+ on tabelog which is close to very good. The host spoke perfect English and was a pro at explaining the courses. The[ beef](https://imgur.com/Ar4m3Ig) was[ very good](https://imgur.com/G7AwcBp) and it was one of my more memorable meals in Kyoto. I booked this on some Japanese reservation site that I cannot find in my history. (‚ÄúIKYOU or something similar?)
* Tokyo: Isshin Daikanyama - 3.6+ on tabelog which is close to very good. Some YouTuber recommended this as a place where locals go to eat. We were about 30-40th in line 30 minutes before the place opened. Luckily we were one of the last 2 tables to be sat in the opening wave of diners so we didn‚Äôt have to wait for tables to turn over. Quality wise, it was a very[ good meal](https://imgur.com/m2KuRRL) for lunch.
* Yakiniku Black Hole Shinjuku - 3.4+ on tabelog. I think I bookmarked this place because of StrictlyDumpling on YT. We walked into this place without reservation on a Tuesday night after Shinjuku Gyeon and were sat promptly. I love all things grill-it-yourself, Korean or Japanese, so this was a pleasant experience. I couldn‚Äôt figure out how to get their touchpad POS into English so i relied on Google translate. Turns out thinly sliced sirloin wagyu is pretty fuckin great and we attempted to recreate our own sirloin sukiyaki with raw egg experience. All-in the meal was super affordable for the[ quality](https://imgur.com/9gC0oQr) of the[ beef](https://imgur.com/hoyCuca) that you get.

**TAKEWAYS/TIPS**

* Was prepared for dealing with trash but damn, it is a real strategic challenge at times. You could rely on an opportunity to dump some trash (and acquire more) by visiting some Family Mart‚Äôs or when you pass through a station.
* You can rely on finding restrooms within specific areas of most stations and often at department stores. Maybe we were hydrating so much but we were pretty conscious to try to use the restroom each time we had a reliable window.
* Hydration is so critical. Drink tons of water on the plane so you don‚Äôt dry out. We were doing 25K steps per day for almost a week straight before we needed to tone it down. I was mowing through Pocari Sweats to stay hydrated from all the walking and casual beer drinking throughout the day at restaurants.
* Don‚Äôt overdo the planning and walking. After several days of 12mi+ and 25K steps, our feet were simply not happy. We ultimately visited Mominoki House for a foot soak or massage in both Shibuya and Kyoto to recharge our bodies for future travel days.
* Get an IC card for local travel, and purchase your tickets online. I don't get why so many people would waste their precious travel time waiting in line to buy tickets. Swiping in and out via IC card was so fast and easy. I did not wind up booking the 2-week or 3-week JR pass for my 16 day trip. Based on my calculations, i wasn't really traveling enough to almost break even.
* When riding buses in Kyoto, you enter through the middle door and pay as you exit the front door. This appears to be backwards from my experience in Tokyo and general common sense assumptions. I saw some foreigners get this mixed up and confused as to why the driver was telling them to do otherwise.
* Kids are so well behaved in Japan and i‚Äôm amazed at how they must be raised. I don‚Äôt have any kids yet but if it did, I‚Äôd want to learn how Japanese parents do it. Seemed like any kid that went noticed was likely a foreign child. At worst, a Japanese toddler would look disgruntled -- but rarely heard. Raising your hands to cross the street is so cute and safe in the world of tons of ambiguous intersections.
* Don‚Äôt always trust your GPS until you can get some better verification, like a printed sign with your station name or take a brief visit to a surface street. There were multiple times where my GPS told me i was in station A, while i was 3-4 stations away in B, and it could have gotten me on the wrong ride.
* Trusting Google Maps and the platform # is your friend. Ultimately knowing which platform to look for got me to the correct destination when running through the maze of a station. I still don‚Äôt think I grasp where the hell is was transitioning between within Shibuya station and the Shibuya Hikarie but I got there. There will be times where you rush into a train going the wrong direction. I would just get off at the next stop and reverse platforms/direction to the right route. It shouldn‚Äôt cost you anything except some time, assuming it wasn‚Äôt a shinkansen or limited ride.
* I prepared and studied-up on about 20-25 phrases in Japanese ahead of time. Besides the obvious basics, the ones that were most useful were probably, Eigo wakari masuka? (Do you know english?), Gomen nasai (sorry) obviously sumimasen (excuse me), ijo desu (that‚Äôs all, when ordering), yoyaku arimasu (i have a reservation), hitori desu(one person) / hitotsu (one thing) and futari desu (two people) and futatsu (two things), kore onegaishimasu (this please, when pointing to the chicken in the window) o kaikei onegaishimasu (check, please) \_\_\_\_ arimasuka? (\_\_\_\_ do you have it?) and \_\_\_\_ wa doko deska? (\_\_\_\_\_\_ where is it?)
* At least within Tokyo and Osaka, a lot of people and youth are fashionable AF. I‚Äôm not sure how many people are busting their ass for long hours to buy a single Celine piece or Prada boots but I was amazed at the sheer volume of luxury shopping and materialism on display. I am glad that both my wife and I have very little interest in that race.
* We did quite a bit of shopping for clothes, gifts and souvenirs. Among my big purchases were the [MIP-25](https://imgur.com/8gKX47x) by HenderScheme, based on the Air Max 90, a jacket from the Human-Made 1928 store in Kyoto, a 210mm [gyuto](https://imgur.com/tHcoMGQ) from Kikuichi in Nara. We returned home with 2 large suitcases that we checked, 1 carry-on roller, 1 medium duffel-bag that held return laundry. We each also had a personal backpack for tech and valuables. We used Yamato transport about 3 times total over 16 days (ex. Kyoto to Osaka allowing Nara daytrip, Osaka to Ginza allowing light Hakone weekend.) Each time was about $17 for each suitcase and it arrived within 24-48hours. For me, it was worth it to avoid breaking into a mad sweaty hustle to move luggage around huge stations.
* A $250 per head sushi meal in Japan vs a $250 per head sushi meal in Austin or Los Angeles seems like it has diminishing returns up to a point. I would assume the quality + consistency of fish is high everyday at this tier in Japan. Whereas back home, I would get access to a very, very nice piece of otoro maybe once every 3-4 months, often times the otoro was average to nice. I think the ability to source very high-quality fish to cities all over the world recently has made very good sushi more accessible to everyone.. I‚Äôm not sure i‚Äôve yet found life-changing sushi. There is always next time‚Ä¶

188rk63,"Scammed in Tokyo, now financially stranded in Osaka","Hi all - my BF and I got drugged, beaten & taken to ATM in Shinjuku on day 2 of our trip. Thankfully our cards all declined the transactions and locked up, but they did take his debit card (cancelled and worthless anyways), our cash (~$100), and my phone. We‚Äôre now left with the consequences being fully locked out of our debit + credit cards and me not having a phone for two-factor authentication for the rest of our trip to Dec 9.

Customer support for our accounts have been effectively useless as they obviously are suspicious given the fraudulent transactions, which I‚Äôm grateful for but is now leaving us financially stranded as they won‚Äôt restore our access and tell us to visit a branch in-person, AKA impossible considering there is no Wells Fargo nor Bank of America in Osaka. Almost all our accounts (Airbnb, etc) are linked to my phone so without TFA this has snowballed into everything and is slowly making this the worst two weeks of our lives. We have been beating ourselves up with regrets every day so *please be kind, we are desperately trying to figure out our options to salvage the rest of the trip.*

Our only lifeline is my Discover credit card and his Google Pay debit card which his bank thankfully authorized for contactless while his new card is sent home in the US. However we‚Äôre realizing most places don‚Äôt take Discover nor contactless, and we can‚Äôt take out cash as ATMs don‚Äôt take contactless. Our hotels from here on out are all prepaid, but trains being cash-only is a challenge. We got into Osaka off the kindness of a couple we begged to let us PayPal & buy Yen off of. 

Is anyone in Osaka we could buy some Yen off of via Venmo or PayPal? Or just have advice? Here is what we DO still have and what we‚Äôve done with it so far. Are we completely fucked or is there any chance we can still get around with this?

We have access to:

-his phone (can do contactless pay for debit card, Venmo/Paypal etc)

-his physical credit card (locked/cancelled, used an emergency cash advance on it yesterday but today we found it cancelled and customer support is saying they cannot reauthorize) 

-my physical debit and credit cards (locked/canceled, bank won‚Äôt authorize anything without TFA)

-my Discover card (our only working credit card, won‚Äôt authorize cash advance without TFA and I don‚Äôt think ATMs take Discover anyways)",https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/188rk63/scammed_in_tokyo_now_financially_stranded_in_osaka/,"MoneyGram and Western Union exist in Japan.

109bdd7,"A first-timer‚Äôs review of an epic trip to Japan (Tokyo, Kyoto, Izu Peninsula)","My wife and I recently got back from an incredible 18-day trip to Japan with stops in Tokyo, where we spent the majority of our time, Kyoto, and the Izu Peninsula. This sub-reddit was instrumental in helping us plan our trip, so a big thanks to everyone who contributes and makes this community so helpful for prospective travelers to Japan. 

To say our expectations for our trip were high would be a severe understatement. We were originally supposed to travel to Japan in March 2020 for a short 10-day trip ‚Äì needless to say, that never happened. Fast forward three years, one pandemic, and a marriage (congrats to us :D) we decided to celebrate our honeymoon by finally making our trip to Japan. It was both of our first visits and it is safe to say that this beautiful country exceeded all of our expectations and gave us the trip of a lifetime. 

I wanted to contribute in my own way to this sub-reddit by sharing some thoughts/feedback below for any travelers looking for some perspective and advice for future travel to Japan. I don‚Äôt think listing out every single step of our itinerary is particularly helpful, so I‚Äôm just going to provide some highlights/thoughts instead. One caveat ‚Äì this was our honeymoon and we certainly balled out. That said, while we had our share of fancy stays and Michelin-starred restaurants/kaiseki meals, many of our most memorable experiences were found in inexpensive ramen joints, lovely cafes, raucous izakayas, and the hidden corners of Tokyo that don‚Äôt cost a dollar to explore. Let‚Äôs begin!

* **The food!** Like many, Japanese cuisine was a driving force behind our visit ‚Äì and the food did not disappoint. I thought that throughout our trip we did a solid job of balancing planning reservations at top destinations and popping in and out of random restaurants we encountered on the streets. I seriously don‚Äôt think we had a single bad meal during our trip. The food standards are so high in Japan that you really can‚Äôt go wrong. Here were some of our favorite spots:
   * Tokyo: We live in NYC, and I‚Äôve long argued that we live in the greatest food city in the world, but Tokyo may be coming for that mantle. Arguably the best meal we had in Japan was at Sushi Yuu. A friend recommended this spot to us and it was easily the best sushi I‚Äôve ever had in my life. The master chef was a great host and was able to speak with us in English throughout our dinner to explain to us what we were eating. Other top highlights include: Sama (Japanese curry in Shimokita), Fuji Ramen, Kurosawa (teppanyaki in Ginza), and GEM by Moto (awesome Sake bar with shared plates in Ebisu). There were many other places that we stopped by on a whim that I don‚Äôt know the names of lol but also provided some fantastic eats. 
   * Kyoto: Coffee Shop Yamamoto in Arashiyama was probably the best cafe we visited on our trip. Some seriously epic coffee and fruit and steak sandwiches (separately of course!). The Nishiki Market was also the source of amazing udon and tempura that we used to fuel our days. We spent the majority of our trip in Kyoto at a ryokan and ate dinner there most nights.
* **The drinks!** My wife and I love a night out on the town and Japan provided us with some nights that we may never remember clearly but certainly will never forget :D. 
   * We spent NYE in Tokyo at the Liquid Room in Ebisu and had the absolute time of our lives! The venue had three different rooms/stages with a variety of musical acts. While we didn‚Äôt know of a single performer going into the night, we left with a long list of Japanese artists and DJs to add to our Spotify playlists. 
   * Despite how touristy Golden Gai can be, we had a fantastic experience bar-hopping in the neighborhood. The very cramped quarters of the bars meant that you almost had to interact with the folks sitting next to you. We ended up staying out until near sunrise one night with a group of salary men that we met at the UpOut bar. The brutal hangover the next day was well worth a night of free champagne (thanks to our new friends!) and debauchery.
   * Karaoke is a must! Even if it's just by yourself or you and your partner, it is worth the experience. 
   * Lost in Translation is one of my favorite movies so we had to make a stop at the New York Bar at the Park Hyatt. We did this on the last night of our trip and the experience of drinking cocktails on top of the world while looking down at the city lights was a very symbolic and reflective note to end our trip on. As long as you go in knowing you'll pay some serious cash for cocktails, I think it is ultimately worth the experience.     
   * Some other bars we loved: Bar Amber (delicious seasonal fruit cocktails), Craft Beer Bar Ibrew Akihabara (awesome list of domestic/international craft brews with some great bar food), and the Prost Bar in Gion, Kyoto (the best Japanese whisky I‚Äôll ever have)
* **The accommodations!** 
   * Tokyo: We stayed in a number of accommodations across various price ranges during our time in Tokyo. While this afforded us the opportunity to see and stay in a bunch of different neighborhoods throughout the city, it also meant that we had to pack, re-pack, and lug our luggage around Tokyo on numerous occasions‚Ä¶ Not totally sure if it ended up being worth it. I recommend Hoshino Resorts OMO5 Tokyo in Otsuka if you‚Äôre looking for an affordable stay. Tsuki Hotel near the Tsukiji Market was also another nice mid-priced option. 
   * Kyoto: We stayed in the newly opened Ace Hotel in Kyoto and it did not disappoint. It perfectly blends the design aesthetic that you come to expect from the Ace Hotel brand with exemplary Japanese hospitality. Highly recommend it if you‚Äôre looking for a more luxurious stay. We also stayed at the Izuyasu Ryokan, which was a real treat. The ryokan has been in the same family for more than 170+ years and each time that a new member of the family assumes the role of the head proprietor they legally change their name to that of the original host of the ryokan. I thought that was the coolest thing and really emblematic of the dedication to one's craft that makes Japan so unique. 
   * Izu: If you‚Äôre looking for the quintessential ryokan/onsen experience, I highly, highly recommend Hanafubuki in Izu Kogen. It‚Äôs only 2 hours from Tokyo but feels like a world away. The ryokan had 7 different private baths ‚Äì some outdoors, some indoors, some mixed ‚Äì that just melt all your troubles away. The ryokan is a five-minute walk to the Jogasaki Coast, which is just about the most beautiful coastline I‚Äôve ever seen. I don‚Äôt think anything will ever beat the feeling of jumping into an open-air onsen after spending a day hiking the rugged coastline. 
* **Getting around!** 
   * Google Maps made navigating Japan a breeze. The Tokyo subway looks like a maze when you first get there but it is surprisingly easy to navigate once you get the hang of it. I recommend adding a Suica card to your phone so you can easily use it to get in and out of stations and add to your balance while on the go. 
   * We opted to purchase the JR Pass and it made travel around the country very accessible. We purchased the tickets in advance of our trip from one of the third-party sites which meant that we couldn‚Äôt make train reservations prior to obtaining the passes while in Japan. I was a bit concerned about this prior to the trip, but those concerns quickly evaporated once we got to Japan. We were able to easily book trains around New Year's, which I understand to be the busiest travel time of the year in Japan.  
      * One thing to keep in mind is that we purchased a 21-day JR pass to cover the entire length of our trip but we really only used the passes during a shorter period of time, meaning we could have saved some money by purchasing a 14-day pass. Something to think about to save you some dough. 
* **More fun things!** 
   * Shopping: My wife and I are both into fashion/street fashion and we came back with enough clothes for an entirely new wardrobe lol. If you‚Äôre like us, keep this in mind when packing or you may have to buy a new suitcase to bring back all your fun new outfits. 
      * Some of our favorite stores included Beams Japan and the myriad thrift shops that are spread out across Shimokita (you could spend days getting lost in all these stores) 
   * Team Lab Planets is a must. You may have seen it all over Tik Tok/Instagram but it is so much more interactive and engaging in person. 
   * All the animal cafes are so much fun. Went to a mini-pig and cat cafe that we had a blast at. 
* **Other random tips/thoughts!**
   * Be prepared to walk‚Ä¶ a lot! We were averaging 15-20k steps a day easily. We are used to walking a lot given we live in NYC, so this wasn‚Äôt too rough on our legs, but I could easily see this being a challenge for those coming from more car-centric environments. 
   * Every single person we encountered was incredibly nice, helpful, and beyond respectful. I found that Japanese people often won‚Äôt make the first contact in conversation, but once you engage them they are excited to chat and practice their English. Not to mention that I am pretty sure service workers there will literally die for you if it came down to it lol. 
   * Highly recommend pre-ordering a pocket WiFi. It‚Äôs not essential but it certainly helped us navigate and translate menus. 
   * I was astonished by how quiet and serene so much of Tokyo is. Coming from NYC where there is just constant noise in every part of the city, it was quite restorative to be in an environment where I could hear myself think without the constant sound of cars honking. 
   * Not to sound creepy but Japanese kids are so adorable. My wife and I were considering volunteering at a local elementary school for a few days (sarcasm). 
   * Prior to our trip, we were under the assumption that Japan was a cash-based society. Not sure if COVID fundamentally changed things, but we did not find this to be the case. Almost everywhere we went accepted credit cards, Apple Pay, Suica/IC payments, etc. 
   * I think there is also a misconception that Japan is cost-prohibitive for many. Sure you can spend all your savings staying at luxury accommodations and hitting Michelin-starred restaurants for every meal. But at the same time, you can find quality hotels for \~$70 a night and the best bowl of ramen of your life for $6. The strength of the USD might have something to do with that right now, but still think that this is a misplaced stereotype of traveling in Japan. 
   * For those planning to travel over the new year in the future, be prepared to encounter closures. It is not as if the entire country shuts down for a few days, but there were definitely some sites and restaurants that we, unfortunately, missed out on. 

If you‚Äôve made it this far, a sincere thanks for reading! If anyone has any questions, I‚Äôm more than happy to answer.

Typing this all out was therapeutic and brought back so many incredible memories from our trip that I‚Äôll cherish for the rest of my life. Japan was everything we could have imagined and more. There is a certain standard of excellence that just permeates everything in Japan, and it makes the culture such a joy to experience. We can't wait to go back.  

But to leave a final piece of advice for prospective travelers, just like anything in life, there is a need for balance ‚Äì and that is especially true for experiencing a new country/culture. Make sure to hit all the things you really, really want to do on your trip, but also make sure to leave some flexibility in your schedule so that you can live in the moment and see where a chance encounter might take you. You won‚Äôt be disappointed.",https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/109bdd7/a_firsttimers_review_of_an_epic_trip_to_japan/,My man!

z6v3dt,Just returned from 16 days in Japan here are some things we noticed.,"Two 26M went to Tokyo-Osaka-Kyoto-Nara-Tokyo. It was both of our first time in Japan. We had a fabulous time and the following are some things we noticed along the way.


-MASKS. Check the rules before you depart for Japan and follow them. I‚Äôm an American living in Europe so I haven‚Äôt had to wear a mask in quite some time but it was an easy transition to get used to them again.

Also I noticed Tokyo and Kyoto had very strict mask policy adherence while I saw many foreigners and Japanese unmasked in Osaka and Nara. Just my experience on the days I was there.

- ITINERARY. if it‚Äôs your first time going like it was mine, be realistic with your itinerary and leave time to enjoy the areas you visit, not just check it off the list. 

I had a pretty detailed itinerary mapped out I shared on this sub, but I found planning multiple neighborhoods per day to be unrealistic and had to adjust. I like to take my time browsing every shelf of an entire 6 story Animate shop then wait in that hour long line for the best omurice in the neighborhood. Before you know it the day is gone and you‚Äôve only done maybe half your itinerary. Save the rest for next time and really soak in your surroundings.

Lastly in relation to planning, let life happen. My first day in Kyoto I met a Japanese girl and we hit it off instantly. Scheduled a date for that night and we didn‚Äôt get back to her place until 5 in the morning which led me to sleep almost all day. That was 2 of my 4 kyoto days gone. I was originally worried about not getting to see everything on my list but decided it can all just wait for my next trip. She did take me to Kiyomizu for hot sake and the temple illuminations on my third day which is something I hadn‚Äôt even heard of. So basically, let life happen and if you‚Äôre a planner and worrier like me, just reassure yourself it‚Äôs okay to deviate and go with the flow.


-Japanese POSITIVE ENERGY we received. From the young arcade worker who took 45 minutes of his time to set us up accounts so we could play the gundam pilot sim game when it‚Äôs clearly supposed to be a do-it-yourself process that we couldn‚Äôt figure out , to the old shop keepers that would return the deep bows I gave them after asking many questions about their goods, everyone was super kind. The other mid-20s people we met out at night said mostly everybody they knew was thrilled to have foreigners back around. Hearing different languages, sharing energy. Everybody just seemed excited. I heard rumors the older folk were the most vocal about not wanting to reopen but the older folk I had chance encounters with were all super friendly. Probably a little selection bias. One time a old man was pushing his wife in a wheelchair and couldn‚Äôt get it up over the edge of the sidewalk so my friend and I grabbed each side and lifted her up on real quick. Tons of bows and thank yous and smiles ensued it was very sweet moment.

- NAVIGATION. Everywhere I read said Google maps is my best friend but Google maps led me to the wrong place twice. If you have iPhone, I used Apple Maps the entire time after Google let me down and Apple Maps was flawless and way more intuitive for me. As for translate I just used basic phrases and hand gestures and never needed it for human interaction but the camera function on Google translate for signs and menus is fabulous.

-PHONES. Last thing I want to mention is phone service in Japan. I bought a Sakura mobile 15 day 4G SIM and couldn‚Äôt get it to work the first few days. After re configuring the APN settings and restarting my iPhone it worked like a charm. If you opt to get a SIM in Japan, make sure you follow the directions to configure these setting exactly as described by your provider.

My first trip was a beautiful experience and I‚Äôm already looking into booking my next one. Maybe for colder months since I was sweating walking around in November! If anybody planning to go soon has specific questions let me know.",https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/z6v3dt/just_returned_from_16_days_in_japan_here_are_some/,How did your love story end?,"I do agree with not overstuffing your days, enjoying it fully and planning some things for the next trip. But this may be the mid-life crisis speaking, especially since my financial situation don‚Äôt allow me to travel often, I can‚Äôt help shake the thought of ‚ÄúIf I don‚Äôt do this now, I don‚Äôt know when else I could do it‚Äù.

But yeah like I said, I do agree with your sentiment. Currently planning my own itinerary and now in the phase of dropping plans that may cause the day to be overstuffed","I agree with everything you wrote. When I worked on our itinerary, some days were just labeled ‚ÄúExplore *CITY WE WERE IN*‚Äù. Other than a few days where we knew an activity would take all day (like Universal Studios), itinerary would list the city and main objective of that day, which is what we started with usually, and then the rest of the day was meant for exploration. It worked out wonderfully. 

Also I had a three tier list. 1- things we absolutely planned to do barring any unforeseen issues. 2- Things we wanted to do nearby assuming we finished the primary day‚Äôs ‚Äòtask‚Äô. 3- stuff we‚Äôd love to do if we find the time. 

We did everything in tier 1, lots from tier 2, a few from tier 3, and of course many things that we didn‚Äôt even plan for. 

It‚Äôs the only way to visit. Don‚Äôt plan everything out.","On the phone front, I was amazed that T-Mobile includes 5GB of LTE data with the plan I have.

Definitely looking to explore some nightlife - can you recommend any of the bars in Tokyo/Kyoto/Osaka that were friendly to foreigners (also open to clubs)? One of my favorite parts of traveling is meeting locals and having interesting conversations. Thanks!"

16y395q,My experience in onsen as a trans man (ftm),"I visited Japan years ago, and relaxing in an onsen is one of my best memories from that trip. I went back to Japan recently, but I transitioned in the meantime. Before my trip, I tried to find information about how to navigate onsen as a transgender person. Most of the posts suggested renting a private onsen, and I couldn't find any feedback from transgender men using public baths.

So, here is my experience. I hope this will help other people in the same situation.

I have been on testosterone for a year and a half and had top surgery six months ago. I pass as a man all the time, and my gender is never questioned. But, as we need to be completely naked in the onsen, and as my genitalia doesn't match the rest of my appearance, I was worried if I could use the men's bath without any issue. SPOILER: I did it, and everything went perfectly fine.

When you go to an onsen, there is always a big towel and a smaller face towel provided. In the changing room, you need to get naked and put all your belongings in a bin or a locker. You also leave your big towel there, but you can keep the little face towel with you. From this point, when I was out of the bath, I casually kept the towel in front of my crotch when walking. When using the shower, as they were always low with a stool, nobody could notice anything because I was sitting. Then, I took back my face towel in front of me to go to the bath. As the towel must not go in the water, I quickly put it on the side of the pool when going into the water. Once in the bath, nobody could really notice what is between my legs, so I could chill and enjoy.

Some Japanese men also hide their private parts in the onsen (though most of the people don't care about being naked). As a tourist, I think I just passed as a shy gaijin, but nobody seemed to care at all and no one glared at me. Most of the time, people just enjoy themselves and don't care about other people. If someone noticed my absence of a penis, nobody said anything.

I went to three different public onsens with my partner (who is a cis man): one was almost empty, and one was very crowded. Though it was more comfortable for me in the less crowded onsen, it was a really good experience each time.

Edit: I didn't made this post to encourage people to do the same. I chose to take the risk to go and I can't tell if it will always be fine. I just wanted to share my experience on this topic as all you can find in most threads are cis people telling you to go to the part of your gender assign at birth (I can't imagine the panic if I went to women's part) or to rent a private onsen. Private baths are indeed the safest solution but is has a cost and you can't enjoy big and various baths on the public part.

I also tried to find a mixed gender onsen which would have been a great workaround. But they are very rare and I didn't find one on my itinerary.


Edit 2 : I had peri for top surgery so I have very small scars that are almost invisible. DI scars would be indeed more noticeable if they are recent and still red. In a comment  from another thread I made in the sub r/ftm, someone went to multiple onsens during a year. They had DI scars and had no issue with it.

Edit 3 : This is my experience as a ftm. Unfortunately I don't think this applies to MTF (without bottom surgery) as there is a lot of moral panic around trans women and it is a lot easier to hide a lack of penis than the other way.",https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/16y395q/my_experience_in_onsen_as_a_trans_man_ftm/,"I'm glad you had a good experience. I think, because of the towels and the general ""don't look"" attitude, people who have had top surgery could pass in the men's onsen. 

Though, I do think people will risk jail time if found out or a heavy beating if the wrong people are in attendance. Especially the other way around without having had all the surgery. 

I recommend a private onsen to protect yourself, but I'm happy it went well for you.","I think the big thing here is you looked the part. You had the top surgery and like you said you look like a man and with the testosterone your body is a mans. While you didn't have male genitalia people could assume there was some medical reason for it. They probably didn't even assume you were trans as such surgeries are still not common in Japan. 

It is most likely the treatment OP would have received would have been very different if they still had a chest and looked feminine.",True bros do not point out another bros missing penis,So excellent you could enjoy the Onsen experience in peace.,"I'm glad it all went smoothly for you!

I am actually also a trans man who lived in Japan for half a year. I'm sorry to hear that you had a hard time finding resources, since I had the same issues before going to Japan, but everything was fine, and I forgot to write it up on Reddit haha.

For context, I am a young (<21 year old) trans man on T, pre-surgeries, and pass 100% of the time. I was involved in a sports club during my time in Japan, and the boys would often change and go to sentos together. During our summer camp, we even bathed up to three times a day. The dynamic when you're involved in a local community, especially as a younger guy, is interesting since I did feel hesitant to show any sign that hinted towards me having *cough* a smaller package (immature, I know haha).

Similar to you, I would be very careful with using the smaller face towel to cover my nether regions whenever I was walking from one place to another after taking off my clothes. I was more often bathing in sentos rather than onsens, and so I would sit in a position where I could cover my private parts a bit more. This did mean I had a harder time 'relaxing' in the baths, but it was what I needed to do to survive. Even though I was prepared to use my gaijin card if anyone asked why I was too shy to not cover my parts, no one actually asked, and everyone was very chill.

Even though I don't have top surgery, I actually gained the confidence during my stay in Japan and frequent exposure to naked guys that my chest was small enough to pass as cis with a bit of gyno. 

I did briefly read the comments and do see the warnings others are giving, but on a human to human level I do want to say that if you are trans, there is a possibility that a lot of these situations you are worried about will not happen, and you will be allowed to enjoy life just like any other person. You are valid and you are normal :)"
at0jbq,7 months hitchhiking in Japan,"This is my story of how I traveled in Japan on a WHV.

After having been raised by an abusive single mother, it was a way for me to regain my independence as a man. I had a minor breakdown a couple of years back that almost pushed me to suicide, but instead I settled on doing something insane to break the cycle. So I worked double full time for half a year to scrape money together, and hit the road. Luckily, I could get a working visa for Japan, where I've always wanted to go, because my country has good diplomatic ties with Japan.

I had signed up for a global volunteer program called [WWOOF](https://wwoof.net/), where I got access to hundreds of hosts all over Japan that I could write to and ask if I could come and stay with for a period of time. The deal was to work 6 hours a day for room and board, and then you got a few days off every week to do whatever you want. It's the absolute best way to learn how the locals live, and to get to know the customs of a foreign culture.

I landed in the southern part of Japan on the island called Kyushu in the middle of winter, and stayed up in the mountains of Kamiyamada at a little chicken farm run by a couple in their 60's. I would get up at 5 every morning to shovel manure for an hour before breakfast at 6. The work was hard and honest, and so were the couple I stayed with. It really helped ground me to the fact that I was in a different country now, and I spent my first month there with them.

I headed onward towards the east coast of Kyushu, to the city of Miyazaki. There, on a mountainside a bit outside the city, I stayed with an old man in his inn that he'd built himself; a series of wooden lodges along a mountain stream, interconnected with long wooden balconies. There was a restaurant and several rooms for guests to stay in, and I would help him preparing food, cleaning rooms, and servicing guests. He was an absolute legend himself, a top chef and fisherman who knew everything and everyone in the entire prefecture, and taught me so many skills that I still apply in my everyday life to this day. Sadly, he'd been through a lot of hardship in his life, and was a heavy alcoholic. Despite that, he had utmost discipline, and really set an example for me on how you need to soldier on. We had a lot of good talks over drinks during the two and a half months I spent in Miyazaki. He was the one who suggested that I began hitchhiking, and taught me how he used to do it back in the 70's when he did a Japan round trip by himself.

It was baffling how easy it was to hitchhike in Japan. I had scheduled a whole two days for the trip to the next place that I was going to, but it ended up taking 9 hours. I rarely had to wait more than 10 minutes for a car to pick me up, and it was people from all aspects of life who gave me a ride. They just seemed happy to help out, and enjoyed talking a bit with a foreigner. The trick to Japan is simply to be polite and considerate of others. As long as you are that, everyone is open and friendly, and I even had people go up to others in parking lots and explain in Japanese that this foreigner needs a ride and if they could help out.

One experience during this first stretch of hitchhiking that really cemented the nature of Japanese people in me was when I ended up at a **massive** rest stop near Beppu on the north side of Kyushu; it was in two levels up a mountainside, separated into essentially two different rest stops, with traffic from four directions coming in. I put up my sign, and within a minute a young Japanese couple came up to me. The wife, in perfect English (which was a surprise, since barely anyone spoke a word of English), that I was at the wrong stop and had to go to the other one. So I picked up all my gear and trotted down there. Again, within a minute, two Japanese truck drivers came up to me and communicated that I was as the wrong one again, and had to go back up to the other one. Half way back up the hill, the couple from before came running down towards me. They sincerely apologized that they'd given me the wrong directions, and offered to drive me directly to my destination despite not going in that direction. I told them they didn't have to, since it was a good 45 minute drive into the mountains, but they insisted. They drove me right to the front door, and even gave me some snacks to eat later, and continued to apologize. I was left so flabbergasted, and didn't really know what to do other than thank them deeply, but they seemed perfectly content as if it was the opposite of a bother to do this. We said our goodbyes, and I never saw them again. From there on I was dedicated to [be as excellent to others](http://sysadmin1138.net/mt/blog/2016/02/03/beexcellent.png) as possible.

I had landed in the hot spring town of Yufuin, located in a valley in the mountains south of Beppu. I was working at a hostel run by the most nuclear family I have ever seen. Husband, wife, and their 3 children, all functioning in sync to make their everyday lives work out. The hostel was run like a well-oiled machine, but the family wasn't stressed out at all about it. They told me how they'd met young and always dreamed about running a hostel and meeting people from all over the world, and now they were living the dream. The Japanese have a concept called '[ikigai](https://hyperisland.imgix.net/2018/05/Ikigai-3.jpg)', which is basically your meaning for existence, which includes finding something you love that you can still earn a living with. And hands down, these people had found it. They constantly had one or two people working for them through WWOOF, and I got to meet a lot different types from all over during my stay with them. They had a hot spring at the hostel, which was an absolute luxury, and I ended up spending a lot of downtime just soaking in the mineral rich waters with a good book.

After the hostel, I went to a little town about 20 minutes from the hot spring town, and stayed with a lone farmer who grew parsley and tomatoes. He was a dude in his 40's who'd been into some rough stuff as a kid Tokyo, but now had moved to a more quiet lifestyle in the countryside. We did honest farm work from dawn till evening, ate hearty meals prepared by his mother, who lived a couple of streets away from him, and then knocked back some beers while watching western movies. I introduced him to a couple, thankfully it's somewhat easy to find Japanese subtitles.

This guy had an ex girlfriend who ran a caf√© together with her aunt in a town over from the one we were in. They also hosted volunteers from WWOOF, and through them I was introduced to a German girl who was traveling around Japan kinda like I was. She was sort of nerdy, and spoke Japanese almost fluently from having studied it at home. She'd never gone hitchhiking before, and since we were going the same way, we decided to hitchhike together to Okayama where she was staying for a couple of days. When we hit the road, I held up a sign with the city name on, and she had one saying ""We speak Japanese <3"", both in Kanji. Suffice to say, the trip that we had scheduled for three days took 12 hours, and I ended up checking in to her hotel with a plan to drink and go sightseeing over the weekend. It was Friday, and she hadn't been out drinking in Japan yet, so we wanted to go out and get boozed. After a quick refresher at the hotel, we hit the streets in our finest clothes, set on having fun. We both wanted to hook up with a Japanese counterpart, so we wingmanned each other the entire evening, but without luck. Way past midnight, we meet some people who speak English, and who invite us to come drinking with them. We hit up some different bars, and along the way I notice that one of the guys in the group that we met is getting a lot of respect from random people we meet on the street, and gets special treatment at the places we go to. It should have been obvious to me that he was Yakuza. Throughout the night, his friends keep asking me if I'm together with the German girl, and I tell them no. When we finally hit up a late night restaurant to get something to eat, the boss of the group starts aggressively hitting on the girl. She's visibly uncomfortable with this, so I step in, and then the guy switches his attention to me. He starts demanding that I go back to the hotel, that he can handle it and that I should mind my own business. The girl tries to comfort him to get him to relax, but he's having none of it. She heads off to the bathroom, and while I'm alone with them, he threatens to kill me if I don't leave right away.

I freak the fuck out and start apologizing profusely, while keeping an eye out for the girl, but he's having none of it. He pulls out his phone and starts texting, which I know is a sign that we need to leave NOW if we don't want to get dragged in to a black van and taken to a warehouse somewhere. So as soon as the girl gets back from the toilet, I bolt up, grab our shit, take her by the arm and run out of the place. First thing I do is to get us on to a main road among people so we could blend in, and then just head back towards the hotel as fast as possible. The girl was shaking and crying, asking what was going on, but I shushed her as I frantically kept checking if we were being followed. Thankfully, we made it back to the hotel, and I sat her down and explained the situation; we didn't know if they knew where we lived, if they'd followed us, or what else, so that we should head out of town as fast as possible. She agreed, and in 15 minutes we were out of the hotel and in a taxi towards the nearest highway rest stop. Keep in mind, at this point it's about 5 in the morning, and we've been knocking back shots and sake the entire evening, but the adrenaline had sobered us up quite well. We flagged down a car that took us to a town some 50km away from Okayama, where we caught a train to Matsue where the girl had some friends we could stay with. We arrived there around 10, and tried finding a hotel with rooms ready. We got some around 13, and she collapsed in hers while I chainsmoked in mine while looking out the tiny hotel window for suspicious cars. Finally, after staying awake for almost 40 hours, I fell asleep.

The next day, the girl and I said our goodbyes as I caught a car headed towards Tottori, and she went off to her friends. I haven't seen her since.

I hitchhiked towards Sasayama, in the Kansai region. Along the way, I got lost in the mountains, and once had to spend the night in the parking lot of a convenience store, under an impromptu shelter made from a tarp. Along the way, I met a couple who'd biked all the way from Germany over Russia and taken a ferry to Japan. I bypassed them a couple of times when I'd caught a ride, and then we'd greet each other when they passed me flagging down a new one. I arrived in Sasayama, and stayed at a homestead that also was a sort of international 'free school'. The kids would come there and learn English from the foreigners working there, and since the couple who ran the place was half Japanese, half American, they spoke mainly English around the house. I had a great time there with them and their unique group of friends in the farming community there, and can proudly say that I'm sure I'm the first in my family to ever have worked in a rice field. It was the perfect combination of comfort and hard work that I needed to calm myself after the experience in Okayama.

At this point I'd been in Japan for about half a year. I hadn't really had time to get my party on, asides from two weeks in Miyazaki where I went to an international bar frequently. So I headed to the party city of Japan; Osaka. There, I got myself a literal broom closet at a cheap-ass AirBNB in the hobo district, but it functioned perfectly for just storing my things and sleeping. One of my first nights there, I met two guys from my home country at a bar, and after not speaking my native language for half a year, we instantly connected and went on an insane 3 week bender together. We did road trips, pub crawls, even went to a massive music festival called Summer Sonic with a day's notice. I'd like to point out that Babymetal had a bigger and wilder crowd than Foo Fighters. Consider that.

They had to head back home, whereas I was far from done traveling. I hitchhiked onward to Tokyo, the city that I'd wanted to visit for over a decade, and got a capsule hotel in the middle of Shibuya. And you know what? I was disappointed. After all I'd experienced, the people I'd met, the festivals I'd attended, the sashimi I'd eaten, the sake I'd drunk, the work I'd done, and the sense of Japanese culture that I'd gained through that, Tokyo was a mediocre amalgamation of the different cultural aspects of all Japan. The people had no soul to them, the food was bland in comparison to what I'd tasted, and every polite act felt faked. After a week, I had had enough and bought a plane ticket to Australia. My working visa had just been approved. So after 4 'random' passport checks at Narita, I caught a plane towards Brisbane, QLD, Australia. But that's a story for another time...

## Preface

Edit: **If it's not in this list, very likely I haven't gone and it might be on my to-go list. Tokyo has way too much good coffee and I don't have nearly enough time to try them all.**

**Feel free to skip this section.**

This is sort of a guide/listing of much of the coffee I've consumed in my recent travels to Tokyo. It's aimed mostly at coffee aficionados or those who are interested in specialty coffee. Hopefully my coffee addiction helps you in some way.

Coffee is one of my hobbies. I drink probably too much of it, and one of the things I do when I travel the US or internationally is find coffee shops to relax, drink, and talk to the staff. I concentrate most specifically on specialty coffee and third-wave coffee shops and roasters, which are focused on a host of things like fair and equitable coffee sourcing, quality of beans, and coffee quality.

Japan has an interesting coffee culture - it's famous for being the birthplace  of canned coffee, buying up most of the world's annual supply of Jamaican Blue Mountain coffee beans, and for the traditional tea/coffee shop called the [_kissaten_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kissaten). In the last decade, there have been a growing number of specialty coffee shops throughout the country, as well as a growth in the number of coffee roasters.

This post isn't a comprehensive list of coffee shops in Tokyo, nor is it even a complete list of coffee shops I've tried, but it's a good start. I'll mostly be ignoring places that are essentially equivalent to places like Starbucks/Dunkin'/Tim Horton's, so that means most places like Doutor and UCC won't be included.

## Additional Notes
Specialty coffee is rather expensive in the grand scheme of coffee, and it is especially expensive in Japan. A normal coffee shop like UCC might charge you 150-350 yen for a cup of drip coffee or an espresso-based drink, whereas a specialty coffee shop will charge more like 350 - 800 yen for the same drinks. For pour over coffee, you can expect to get maybe 200 mL (~6.8 fluid ounces) for that money, which is anywhere from 30-50% less coffee than you'd get in the states for the same money. Espresso-based drink prices are roughly in-line with American prices for a similar volume of liquid.

If you buy coffee beans from specialty shops, you are looking at the equivalent of buying them for anywhere from 4000-10000+ yen per pound. Compare to prices in the US, where I'd pay $25-50/lb for the same quality coffee beans.

I will also add some important bits of info for each shop up front, like website, prices of the most common drinks, and language-friendliness. I speak English and a decent amount of Japanese, but I know a lot of tourists run into language issues so I will give my assessment of the staff and shop in regards to how friendly they are for English speakers.

If you're a coffee enthusiast, Glitch would be the only place on this entire list I would say you should go out of your way for. And go out of your way you will. They're located in the business-y part of Kanda, near Jimbocho Station. I walk the kilometer here from the Kanda or Akihabara areas multiple times every trip.

The coffee shop is very modern in design, and can get very busy and packed, with only a few tables and some counter seating. Their main clientele are local employees and tourists. Of all the coffee shops I've been to in Japan, this one had the second-most number of tourists I've seen, because the shop is extremely famous in the coffee community and appears on all sorts of ""Best of..."" lists. And the fame is well-deserved; all the coffee I've had here has been fantastic.

For pour-over coffee, they normally have a selection of 6-8 coffee beans you can choose from, with prices ranging from 650 yen for some of their mainstay coffees like Ethiopia Kochere Sakoro to 1500-2000 yen for some of their most interesting coffees like their Geshas or anaerobic-processed coffees. As a huge fan of Ethiopian coffees, their selection has never disappointed, and I've had at least 4 different staff members make me pourovers with many different beans. The coffee has always been fruity, sweet, nicely acidic, and sometimes has really surprising notes.

For those who prefer milk and espresso, I like both their flat white and latte. My wife has at least 2 lattes every visit, as Glitch's are her favorite in the world. A combination of their beans and the milk they use (from Hokkaido) produces a latte that is naturally exceptionally sweet without a lot of the coffee taste she can't stand.

## Fuglen Coffee
* Location: Asakusa and Shibuya
* Website: [FUGLEN](https://www.fuglen.no/)
* English-friendliness: Basic menus are in English, most staff members speak decent English.
* Latte: 520 yen.
* Pourover coffee: 500 - 800 yen.

I've been to the Asakusa location multiple times, located at the edge of the Sensoji area. This is a coffee shop from Oslo, Norway which, strangely enough, has more locations in Japan than they do in their home country.

The Asakusa location is quite spacious, with two floors, and despite being located on a street with heavy pedestrian traffic, I've never found it to be overly crowded any of the times I've gone, even in the middle of the day. The aesthetic is modern, with the second floor looking like it came out of the 1970s. I've been told this is a very Norwegian aesthetic.

Their coffee is quite nice - the beans are roasted Nordic-style, so they are going to be a little acidic. This comes out even in their milk drinks - I've had multiple cappuccinos and cortados there, and the coffee is very palatable, balanced, and smooth. My wife isn't much of a coffee drinker, but she has ordered multiple mochas here and loves them, which is high praise from her.

### The Roastery by Nozy Coffee
* Location: [Jingumae, Shibuya](https://goo.gl/maps/Zo3zoZzG9P2UvMzw8)
* Website: [MENU(E) | THE ROASTERY](https://www.tysons.jp/roastery/en/menu/)
* English-friendliness: Menus in English, all staff spoke excellent English.
* Latte: 500-1000 yen depending on coffee bean choice
* Pourover: 680 yen regardless of bean choice

Coffee is a very individual thing, but I will say this up front: I do not like this place. This is completely counter to everything else you'll read on the internet, because The Roastery by Nozy is considered one of the top coffee shops in the country by tourists. I had both a latte and a pourover here, and both tasted exceedingly normal with no special qualities to either, which was disappointing given the prices they charge. I would equate their milk drinks to being like a slightly better Starbucks. If you were in the area and considering going here, I'd instead recommend going elsewhere in the area, like to Chatei Hatou, which I will list next.

The staff are super friendly and the space is large, but it will feel cramped because this place is in an extremely busy shopping district and attracts a lot of people. It also attracts a lot of tourists, which is probably why all the staff members speak really good English.

Outside this place is a tiny cart that sells pretty good _agepan_, though, so if you're around, I'd buy it for a snack.

## Chatei Hatou
* Location: [Near Shibuya Station](https://goo.gl/maps/PUZSqiHQxRdrNfmf6)
* Website: None
* English-friendliness: Basic menus in English, staff do not speak English.
* Cappuccino: 950 yen
* Pourover: 800-1000 yen depending on bean
* Quirks: This place requires everyone in your party to order a drink. They are _very particular_ about where you sit.

	* [Cappuccino and Cafe](https://i.imgur.com/6ToMUL0.jpg)

Chatei Hatou is a _kissaten_ that's been around for 30+ years, so it's a lot more traditional. Their coffee beans are charcoal-roasted, so they end up being very robust in taste. I actually find their coffee very drinkable black, but I'd probably be considered the minority here. Having been here several times, I find their coffee smooth and very full-bodied, and the staff pays a lot of attention to their brewing as well as what your coffee is served in. I've seen the head barista (whom I affectionately refer to as Mad Hatter) change the cup he wanted to serve my coffee in right before pouring it.

Chatei Hatou is also famous for chiffon cake, and usually has several flavors available. The cake is delicious, light, fluffy, with airy frosting, and pairs well with the dark coffee.

I guess it also has to be mentioned that this place was the inspiration for the founder of Blue Bottle Coffee.

## Blue Bottle Coffee
* Location: Various (I went to the Kanda one)
* Website: [„Éñ„É´„Éº„Éú„Éà„É´„Ç≥„Éº„Éí„Éº](https://bluebottlecoffee.jp/cafes#tokyo)
* English-friendliness: English menus, staff at my shop spoke decent English
* Latte: 500 yen
* Pourover: 600-700 yen

It's Blue Bottle - the taste is consistent across continents. I generally like their coffee and I'd pick it over The Roastery by Nozy if given the choice. It's always a perfectly fine place to grab a coffee if you need one and beats out Japan's more standard offerings of Doutour/UCC/etc. 

## Cafe de L'Ambre
* Location: Ginza
* Website: None
* English-friendliness: basic English menus, a couple of the younger staff members have excellent English
* Coffee prices: 700-1100 yen - they don't do steamed milk drinks and instead do coffee-with-milk
* Pictures:
	* [Shop Sign](https://imgur.com/qv3c56X)

Another _kissaten_, Cafe de L'Ambre is from a very different time. It was founded in 1948, and the owner passed away in 2018 at the age of 104. This place serves only coffee, coffee-based cocktails, and some coffee-based sweets like pudding and jelly.

It is very much the antithesis of places like Blue Bottle or Glitch, being very dark, very smoky, and exceedingly cramped. This is a place that gets very crowded during the day time with salarymen and a fair number of tourists.

They roast a very wide selection of coffee beans from all over the world, and they use Hario Nel drippers to make their pour overs. I only drink pourovers when I go to Cafe de L'Ambre, and while I'd prefer pourovers from Glitch or some other shops on this list, their coffee is robust, smooth, and flavorful.

The major draw here should be some of their coffee cocktails, though. My wife always gets the Queen Amber here, which is a sweet, cold milk and coffee-based drink served in a champagne glass.

## Streamer Coffee Company
* Location: Various, I went to the original location in Shibuya
* Website: [STREAMER COFFEE COMPANY | HOME](http://streamer.coffee/)
* English-friendliness: Full English menus. The person who served me was a native English-speaking Japanese-American.
* Latte: 500-800 yen
* Pourovers: Not available
* Pictures:
	* [Shop Exterior](https://imgur.com/dfXeWXO)

I'm going against the popular sentiments you see on sites like Yelp: I'm not a fan of Streamer Coffee's coffee. They are very much an espresso-oriented coffee shop, but I found their coffee to be exceptionally dark, so all the flavors I got out of their drinks were just ""dark roasted coffee."" Their drinks are also overly sweet, and many of their coffee drinks are very Starbucks-style with things like caramel swirls and other additives. Their latte art game is on-point, though.

I feel this is the place you'd go if you wanted coffee that tasted like what you'd get from mass-market places like Starbucks.

## Sarutahiko Coffee
* Location: Various, I went to one of the new locations in Akihabara Atr√© shopping center
* Website: [AboutÔΩúSpecialty Coffee Shop in Ebisu, Tokyo/ Sarutahiko Coffee](https://sarutahiko.co/en/about/)
* English-friendliness: English menus. Staff at my shop spoke mostly Japanese.
* Latte: 430 yen
* Pourover: 400-600 yen
* Pictures:
	* [Shop Exterior](https://imgur.com/U0supXE)

This is a specialty coffee chain that's been aggressively expanding over the last two years or so. I think they fall into the trap of having way too much choice in terms of coffee bean selection and drinks, but I found their latte perfectly fine for something that cost 430 yen. I'd say similar to a Blue Bottle.

## Faith Coffee
* Location: [Shibakoen/Hamamatsucho/Daimon area in Minato](https://goo.gl/maps/dcwggJsGk8L3w2ep6)
* Website: https://faith-coffee.com/
* English-friendliness: I don't know, owner and I spoke in Japanese. Basic English menu.
* Pourover: 500-700 yen
* Pictures:
	* [Shop Interior](https://i.imgur.com/CaOs85C.jpg)

If you find yourself in the Hamamatsucho area, perhaps because you went to Tokyo Tower or goshuin-hunting at Zojoji or Hoshuin, you can't go wrong with getting a coffee at Faith Coffee.

This place was founded by and run by Reiji, a Q Grader (a certification recognizing an ability to judge the quality/taste of coffee beans). He is a nice and friendly guy who roasts all the coffee the shop brews/sells, and while the shop is small, it is airy and wasn't particularly crowded.

The only choices you get here are pour over coffee, chai, and apple juice. You get to choose from the several beans the shop is roasting at that time, and I'm fairly certain that the shop doesn't offer anything like sweeteners or milk, so you should like your coffee black if you come here.

The coffee itself was nice. I picked an Ethiopia Aricha and Reiji poured over my coffee with a Hario v60. The coffee was nicely acidic with some strong citrus notes, very drinkable.

## KOFFEE MAMEYA
* Location: [Omotesando](https://goo.gl/maps/4FJchryK1UsXoZFP9)
* Website: [KOFFEE MAMEYA](https://www.koffee-mameya.com/)
* English-friendliness: Staff members speak very good-excellent English.
* Pourover: 500-1000 yen
* Pictures:
	* [Coffee bar/selection](https://i.imgur.com/0AKMFfQ.jpg)

I'm going to start off by saying a few things:

1. Koffee Mameya _is not_ a coffee shop
2. Koffee Mameya _is_ a coffee bean shop
3. I think intermediate/advanced coffee enthusiasts would enjoy it most

I list those things because I want to set up expectations, and because I see a lot of people who line up for this place and not understand what it's really about.

Koffee Mameya sells a variety of coffee beans that they source from roasters throughout Japan and the rest of the world. They do not roast any of their own beans. At any given time, they will have between 20-30 coffee beans available for sampling and purchase. 

You should go with the expectation that you will spend 2000-4000 yen on coffee and beans, and to expect to line up for at least 30 minutes just to ""order.""

I say that last part because the entire experience is similar to buying a car. There are typically three baristas working behind the bar, and each one almost always focuses on just a single customer (or related group) at a time. There aren't really any time limits to how long a barista will spend with any particular customer - the first time I went, there was a customer there who spent at least 45 minutes there, drinking a cup of coffee and talking with the staff about pop culture.

When it is finally your turn to meet with a barista, the barista asks some questions to gauge your coffee knowledge. This really dictates how your overall interaction and experience will be. Since I'm a hobbyist, my interactions at Mameya are about what kind of coffee flavors I like, and discussing things like brew methods or favorite coffee shops. Many people who go to Mameya tend to be tourists who are coffee newbies, though, and so their discussions are more focused on basic things like how to make coffee or why different coffees cost such differing amounts of money.

And on the money bit, as mentioned, expect to spend a fair amount here. If you want to sample any of the coffees, the barista will brew a cup for you, for 600-1000 yen per cup. If you wanted to buy coffee beans, they normally cost 1800-5000+ yen for 150 grams of coffee. In American terms, this works out to be about $50-150/lb.

Still, Mameya is a fantastic experience for coffee lovers, especially if you have 60-90 minutes of your day to burn on waiting in line and then talking with staff. I'd recommend trying anything from MOMOS Coffee (a South Korean coffee roaster) if they have any, as well as anything from Coffee Collective (a Danish coffee roaster).

I‚Äôm an iced coffee-type of person (season doesn‚Äôt matter for me) and I have this ever growing list of places to visit on my Google list. 

A few I would recommend for you (if ice coffee is your thing, I rarely order anything else):

Bongen Coffee (Ginza) - take out only kind of shop with specialty coffee. One of the few places where I saw kopi luwak coffee. Very modern Japanese type of place. 

And Coffee Roasters (Hibiya) - kind of hidden on the 3rd floor of Hibiya Midtown. Great ice coffee and is part of a larger unique and Showa-style designed food court. 

Tajimaya Coffee House (Shinjuku) - Kissaten style, dark roasted...the kind of ice coffee that tastes better in a copper cup but they serve it in a champagne flute. Still good, but popular with tourists as it‚Äôs right next to Piss Alley. 

Kugutsusou (Kichijoji) - coffee place with an underground cave setting. Coffee is also kissaten style with a nice deep taste. Their curry seems to be a popular item too. 

And there‚Äôs a lot of more to list at the moment, but those are the ones that pop out to me.","I would highly suggest Turret Coffee, if you're spending the morning in Tsukiji.  It's right around the corner, and pulls a solid cappuccino.","Have you been to Switch Coffee or Little Darling Roasters? I was surprised these didn't make your list. I agree with your comments about Glitch, The Roastery, Streamer, and Blue Bottle. But I do think Switch stacks up with Glitch. While it is not as well known, they don't mess around. I was pleasantly surprised to find Little Darling recently. The vibe there is completely different and is a great place to hang out.","Thank you!!

I‚Äôm a barista and this list is already helping me with my coffee planning for my trip in March."
134gj4u,Has anyone else had really bad experience as a women traveling in Japan (Tokyo)?,"This is my first time traveling to Tokyo, and I‚Äôve been having a great time. However I‚Äôve never been groped, fondled more in this week then in my entire 27 years of life. It‚Äôs really starting to sour the experience. I‚Äôm had my butt, vagina, breast groped. Even going under my shirt. 

This has happened on the train, club, bar and just plain street. Pretty much anytime there is a crowd. 

The times that I saw who it was, they would just pretend nothing happened. Staff don‚Äôt care.

Is this a normal occurrence?

Edit: Just so people know I have taken preventive measures, I didn‚Äôt go out alone. Met with other solo travelers. Avoided rush hours and have been taking Ubers. Staying in Ginza. Have just been wearing plain shirts and jeans. It‚Äôs happened in broad day light with lots of people around.",https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/134gj4u/has_anyone_else_had_really_bad_experience_as_a/,I'm so sorry that happened to you. I've been here six years and never had it once but I'm not their type. They don't go for the the type that stands out too much. They usually target the type that looks like they wouldn't make a fuss. Next time grab their hand and yell chikan!,"A female friend of mine living in Kumamoto has told me that the best way to get these scum lords on the back foot is to whip out your phone, start recording and shove it in their face and start chewing them out. Some women also keep pins on their person that they can grab and prick (stab) unwanted hands with.

If your luck has genuinely been THIS bad with this stuff, start sticking to the women's only cars on the train when ever possible, stay on the outer edge of crowds, and get pictures and video of your attacker and go STRAIGHT to the nearest Koban or train authority.","When I was younger (20-22) yes, it happened. Mostly in clubs, which are dicey for that in most countries, but definitely more often. Never on the train because I avoided rush hour or used the women only train car (marked on the platform by a pink marker with flowers, operates only during rush hours). Sadly this car exists because it's a bit of a Thing in Japan.

I had a lot of friends though that never experienced it. I assume in my case it was because I had prominent boobs and butt, and looked shy enough that they'd get away with it.","Next time.somebody grope you, shout CHIKAN, point to the guy. Happened to me too. Takr care.",

**Day 2**

* Arashiyama Bamboo Forest - 
* Kinkaku-ji
* Kyoto Imperial Palace
* Snack options: % Arabica Arashiyama

**Tips/Trick**

* Add **Suica card to your Apple Wallet** \- get it linked to your Apple Pay/Credit Card. I found that Mastercards works better than Visas, so be on the lookout. I found that I‚Äôm always on my phone looking at the direction at the train station, so having to just tap my Suica for the gate is so much better. Suica also works for bus rides too and I found it better than taking out my JR passes. Top up is also so easy. Works in Kyoto system (bus and train) too. 
* **Download Google Translate** and use the picture capability to take a picture and get it translated. Works about 90% of the time and I love it. 
* **Follow the line**, even better if it‚Äôs mostly Japanese folks. Even if the restaurant doesn‚Äôt advertise that they have an English menu, most likely than not they have an English menu inside. If they don‚Äôt, use tip #2 to help you out. 
* Most places are not open until 10 or 11, so be ready to **get breakfast from conbini** (7-11, Lawson, Family mart) unless you are ok to eat at westernized places like Starbucks or Tully‚Äôs coffee. 
* **Google map everywhere** \- it will tell you which train line to take, which train stop, even all the way to which station exit is the closest to your destination
* I‚Äôm glad I did **eSim via Ubigi** rather than bringing in pocket wifi. My/my husband‚Äôs day pack is already full day-to-day, adding pocket wifi plus having to charge it overnight would be another thing to think about. Ubigi works great at most places. T-Mobile also works great in most places. 
* Drink your choices of drinks, I know most foreigners would prefer the familiar beers like Asahi, Sapporo, or Kirin Ichiban. But the young and hip Japanese are drinking this mixed drink of **shochu + oolong/green tea**. Sochu is a Japanese liquor typically made from potatoes, much like sake is a rice wine. If you see Japanese people drinking a tall glass of colored drinks (like ice tea) this is what it‚Äôs made of, some young Japanese folks told us that this is what they‚Äôre drinking. 
* Buy your souvenirs and snacks at **Don Quijote -** we got extra luggage for all of our souvenirs here too LOL 
* Bring coin purse - this is very true 
* Be ready to have cash at hand since most places can only accept cash
* I didn‚Äôt exchange cash ever, I just took out cash at the ATM machine at the conbini. I have Schwab Checking Account 
* Instead of going to Tokyo Skytree or Shibuya Sky, we went to the Tokyo Metropolitan Government Observatory for free entrance. We went twice at night and in the morning, no queue at all, and again it‚Äôs free!
* Trench coat among the ladies seems to be more common than any jacket style 
* Bring the most comfy shoes! We averaged 20-25k steps per day, my feet are tired in the afternoon typically and that‚Äôs when we rest at some of the cafes listed above
* There‚Äôs not enough days to eat everything that we‚Äôre looking for - wish we had more days!!!",https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/12c6v5h/trip_report_lesson_learned_first_japan_trip_tokyo/,"For those that use android phones, put your suica card inside your phone cover. It'll work the same way. Just tap your phone on the gate.","Specifically wrt taking cash out at conbini ATMs, I had the best luck at 711 where they gave the option to take out 10,000yen in a bundle of 1000yen banknotes. Very nice to have smaller bills on hand instead of having to worry about breaking a 10k bill.","I will be there next week and this is one of the most helpful recent posts Ive seen. Thank you!

Did you do JR pass + Suica or just Suica?","Don Quixote can have lots of snacks and souvenirs but other tourists also have the same idea, so queues can be ridiculously long, especially late at night when most other places are closed. Sometimes the cashier and tax-refund queues are separate and you will have to queue twice. Could depend on which outlet you go to. In the Shibuya and Ginza branch, it was always crowded! In one store in Nagoya, we had the place all to ourselves. 

Price-wise, they are not always the best. I feel they used to be, years ago, but that seems to have changed since then but they are still attracting based on the discount image they have. Cannot speak for all products so here‚Äôs a couple of examples. (1) 10 boxes of pocky at 1680 yen. It was 158 per box at a local supermarket. (2) A pack of Furikake advertised to be a great price! 200 yen. At the supermarket it was 210 for double the gram amount. But the packets looked exactly the same so it was easy to overlook. Not big amounts in the grand scheme of things, for sure, but overpaying plus overqueueing, I would just make one trip for the experience and shop elsewhere.","Shochu can be made from different ingredients, like rice. Some popular drinks mix it with juice like lemon sour. Whiskey is also popular as highball (mixed with sparkling water). Don‚Äôt know where you live for Asahi and kirin to be familiar, but there is plenty of craft beer too.

Don‚Äôt forget nihonshu (sake) and umeshu (plum liquor) that are just some of the other options."

Both of us have kept track of every $ spent! I hope to share this info to show that you can travel to unique places on a tight budget! 

In Europe, we used a daily budget of $37.50 or $75 combined. This was not possible in Japan, we did not set a $ amount that we had to be under but we did try to be frugal and the budget was in mind all the time. 

IF YOU ARE COMING TO JAPAN ON HOLIDAY I REALLY RECOMMEND SAVING MONEY AND SPENDING IT! 

This was my 3rd time in Japan and my girlfriend‚Äôs 1st. In Europe, we did not feel we missed out on much by being on a budget but in Japan, it is a different story. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, we had a lot of fun, but there was so much left undone because of the budget. It mostly boils down to food. We ate a lot of meals from convenience stores. We skipped a lot of the expensive seafood that if I was on holiday would have bought without a second thought.

We tried to always eat the local specialty. Raw chicken sashimi in Kagoshima and Fugu in Shimonoseki are good examples of that. 

You definitely can do things on a budget, we went to Fukuoka the tonkotsu(pork broth) ramen capital of Japan, and ate at some of the highest-rated ramen restaurants, which was very affordable. A lot of major sights and attractions are free. 

This is just one person's spend and we split basically everything. I'd love to answer any questions about the budget or destinations. If you have any questions you may feel free to ask or DM me.

All numbers are in USD$.

IN TOTAL I SPENT $2,768.28 or $58.89 per day. THIS INCLUDES ACCOMMODATION/ FLIGHTS/ RAIL PASS

Some detail about the categories:

Accommodation $1,006.91 - Hostels were the primary accommodation. It was always a mixed dorm and never a private room. 5 nights we spent in an airbnb solely because there were no hostel beds available. 6 nights were ‚Äúfree‚Äù thanks to my cousin who lives in Akita and let us stay with him. I put quotes on that because while he didn‚Äôt charge us to stay with him, we did end up paying \~$130 to take the Shinkansen from Akita back to Tokyo, and bought him a few meals and stuff. 2 nights were spent in hotels because stuff went sideways (more on that later)

Activities $97.73 - Castles, Capybara and Micro Pig Cafes, Ninja Theme Park, Museums, and Onsens.

Alcohol $103.21 - I drank so much more during my time in Japan compared to Europe. I want to say it was because it was so cold out and meeting/socializing with so many other people in hostels. 

Coffee $8.34 - This is the occasional coffee from a 7-Eleven or a vending machine. 90% of the time I drink coffee at the accommodation. I did bring with me a lot of caffeine pills. I really like how I can wake up and just pop a 200mg caffeine pill and be good to go, they are also cheaper than coffee. My girlfriend doesn't take them primarily because she enjoys drinking coffee so much. The pills are $.03 each. 

Food $341.93 - Food/Water/Etc bought from Supermarkets/Convenience Stores/etc basically any food that wasn't ordered from a restaurant/bakery.

Health $25.76 - Toothpaste, Mouthwash, Soap, Shampoo, etc.

Misc $14.03 - Kerosene to refill my cousins heaters. 

Mobile Phone $0 - I don't have a travel phone plan from the States, but my girlfriend does. If I didn‚Äôt have her phone to use I would have bought a sim card. 

Souvenir $4.08 - I try to buy a magnet in each country 

Transportation(local) $184.79 - This is using trains/buses to get around a city. We did not take a taxi or use a ride-share app while in Japan. 

Travel $595.96 - Anything that takes us from one city or country to another. Our flight was paid for with 35,000 American Airlines miles +$5.60. This also includes our 21-day Rail Pass. 

Cities Visited:

1. Tokyo
2. Kyoto
3. Uji
4. Osaka
5. Nara

Things that went right: The Japanese people are so friendly and welcoming. When the trains got canceled and we got stuck in Yonago, the people working at JR tried everything they could to help us. We walked to 7 different hotels with snow coming down and we must have walked past this one cafe so many times because the old couple who ran it came out to ask if we were ok and the husband walked with us to 4 more hotels and spoke to the people for us to get us a room. 

The couple who sat next to us at the Izakaya in Kagoshima helped us because we had no idea what we were doing. Ended up becoming friends and spent the next 4 hours sharing food and drinking together. 

The random people who would ask if we needed help navigating the train stations. The people are lovely. 

What went Wrong: The weather. This was to be expected since we flew into Japan on December 30. Our plan was to visit Matsue, and then take the overnight train from Matsue to Tokyo and continue on to Kanazawa. The massive amount of snow canceled those trains, we ended up getting ushered onto a train that went to Yonago and then that got canceled so a lot of people were forced to get hotel rooms (see above for the hero of that story). There was no guarantee we could get out of Yonago because it snowed all night but we got to the station at 5:45 am to try and get the 6 am train and we managed to escape! We did not get to go to Kanazawa because the trains all got canceled and we were afraid of getting stuck there and missing our reservation in Sapporo for the Snow Festival. 

While the Shinkansen rarely gets canceled the express trains and local trains get canceled all the time due to weather. Something to note.

Favorite Cities:

1. Hakodate - Cool history, good food, very cute.
2. Kagoshima - Amazing food, the soy sauce there was the best I have ever had. You can eat raw chicken sashimi there (torisashi), I thought it was ok but not great. Sand onsen nearby was amazing. 
3. Sapporo - Big city, the food in Hokkaido is absolutely incredible. Lots of cool day trips to take from here. 

Some useful resources: 

1. Ramen Database- Also has curry, gyoza, udon, soba, etc. you can search by all time ranking, by year, by prefecture, pretty cool tool and we used it a lot to find some amazing food! Ramendb.supleks .jp
2. JR pass calculator, you can plan out your route and it will show if it is worth getting the JR pass. 

I don‚Äôt know if this is allowed but we have made and are making more budget-oriented videos about this trip across Japan. You can find that stuff on our Reddit profile. 

I hope this helps anyone who dreams of going to Japan but doesn't have a ton of money. Feel free to message me if you have any questions or want more info!",https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/116xyz2/47_days_in_japan_for_276828_or_5889_per_day_full/,"It's cool to see Hakodate as one of your favourite cities to visit. I'm planning a visit there in a few months and was on the fence whether to make a trip there or just forego it for more time for rest of Hokkaido as it's out of the way.

Best memory in Hakodate?","Great write up! But I feel you should value the flight at a certain price point because not everyone has points or just include it in final calculation. Just confirming, this was for you only right? not your girlfriend? So it would be 2x for both of you? I ask this because you use ‚Äúour‚Äù alot.

Looking at your trip it makes me really jealous. My longest trip to japan was right out of college when i had no money and knew nothing about what to do (60 days) Nowadays we have the money but no time to do more than 2 weeks",Kinda feel cheated that you had so many miles saved up for the flight tickets but bravo non the less!,I‚Äôd recommend spending a lot more so you don‚Äôt have to eat conbini food (not that there‚Äôs anything wrong with that). Some of my meals in Japan would cost 1/3 of this budget. Expensive but worth it in my opinion.,I'll never understand how some people turn a vacation into an exercise more insidious and tedious than doing actual work.
wn22v7,My Experience As A Post-COVID Tourist,"*TL;DR - As a first-time visitor, I thought visiting Japan under the current conditions was still worth it.*

Yes, hello, it is I, one of the [8000 foreign tourists](https://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/en/news/20220810_02/) Japan‚Äôs had since opening for group tours, here to tell you about my trip. Obviously, I am only one person with one experience, one company, and one tour guide, and you may hear things from other folks that don‚Äôt line up with my experience.

**The Road To Japan**

My husband and I started looking at tour options on June 10th under the assumption that some companies might not start booking before then. Due to work constraints, we had a predetermined three-week block we were looking at, and a quick day‚Äôs search found only one company that offered a long-ish tour during that timespan. The actual dates for the tour we ended up with were July 24-Aug 3.

As soon as we paid for the tour, the company started reaching out immediately about next steps. First step was sending them passport copies - this was for ERFS registration. This was done completely on the company‚Äôs end. I submitted the passports to them on a Friday and the ERFS certificates were ready on Monday.

The next step was applying for our visas. This was the most stressful - or at least time-consuming - part of the process. I found two different lists of requirements on the consulate‚Äôs website, both of which had at least one item not found on the other. The full list of items we ended up submitting were:

* Passports
* Visa applications (with photos - we just got standard passport photos from Walgreens)
* ERFS certificates
* Flight confirmations for both the arriving and departing flights
* Bank statement
* Proof of being tour members (provided by company)
* Tour itinerary (provided by company)
* Description of COVID measures the tour was taking (provided by company)
* Hotel list (provided by company)
* Guide contact info (provided by company)
* Authorization form for me only (my husband went to the consulate to apply in-person, so this allowed him to apply on my behalf)

Had we mailed in our applications, we would have needed a mail liability form - which states they are not responsible for items lost in the mail - instead of the authorization form.

He applied for our visas on Friday, July 1st and was told to return on Monday, July 11th to pick up the passports with visas. These were ready at that time.

COVID screening was all done via the mySOS app. The app‚Äôs screen color indicates progress; after travel information and vaccine records have been reviewed and approved, the red screen turns yellow. After submitting a negative PCR test (within 72 hours of departure of the actual flight that will land in Japan), the screen turns blue.

Also we were required to buy travel insurance, but the government never checked on that, just the tour company.

Processing at Haneda Airport was just the COVID/mySOS checkpoint (which everyone entering Japan has to do) and the immigration stuff that was probably always there.

**Actual Experience In The Country**

(We got off to a weird start with a weather-related missed connection that resulted in us getting to Japan a whole 24 hours after we were supposed to. Thankfully, arriving on a day after the one we‚Äôd put on all our forms did not set off any alarms, though we did have to get a second set of PCR tests at a layover airport since our original tests were going to expire.)

Quarantine: No, we were NOT required to quarantine on arrival due to coming from a [blue](https://www.mhlw.go.jp/stf/covid-19/border\_category.html) country. Folks coming from yellow and red countries may still need to.

Masks: Yes, though not precisely enforced? There was one family in our group who were frequent masks-below-the-nosers and no one spoke to them about it. But otherwise everyone was consistent about wearing them properly and even followed residents‚Äô lead on wearing them outside in 100 degree heat.

Disinfection: We were required to use hand sanitizer each time we got back on the tour bus, and everyone used all the sanitizer stations we ran across while out and about.

Supervision: Not really! At the end of the day‚Äôs scheduled stops, the guide dropped us at the hotel and just told us when to meet him in the morning, and whatever we wanted to do until then was up to us. We also had a full free day in Tokyo, as well as small amounts of free time at individual tour stops. Which I imagine is how tours have always worked?

Extensions: It does sound like we could have added on a few free days at the end of the tour; most of our group was headed back to Tokyo for a day or two after the end of the official schedule. So ask your tour company, it can‚Äôt hurt!

Otherwise our experience was probably the same as any pre-pandemic tour, with two exceptions:

Number of people: Obviously, we did not run into many other tourists! We saw one or two other obvious groups in Kyoto, but that was about it.

Language: You can tell that most businesses (specifically places like restaurants and non-tourist stores) have not had English-speaking customers in a long while. My husband can read quite a bit of Japanese (all three systems), but has only a very basic speaking ability while I have essentially none, so we had a few rough interactions. To be clear, there was plenty of patience on both sides, it just got complicated sometimes.

**Was It Worth It?**

If I had to do it over again, I would have pushed back the trip a couple months just due to heat, but otherwise, yes, I think the trip was worth it. As a first-time visitor, it was nice to have sort of a sampler of locations; we would have liked more time at several of our stops, but the evenings did allow for that a little bit. Also, we were our tour guide‚Äôs first group in two and a half years, and at the end of the tour he cried because he was so happy to be back at his old job. I hope Hide-san continues to get eager visitors to show around!",https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/wn22v7/my_experience_as_a_postcovid_tourist/,"Just a note as this question has already popped up frequently - [some private tours,](https://gowithguide.com/japan) possibly similar to the one OP has taken, are averaging about $200-$250 a day for a tour guide. ~~Depending on the length of your trip, and type of guide provided, that's anywhere from $1,400.00 - $1,750.00 for 7 days, to $6,000.00 - $7,500.00 for a month of vacation with a private escort.~~

Edit to Add: 30 days is probably highly unlikely, the longest package tour currently available from one tour agency seems to be about 11 days maximum, before any extra add-on days - [and that's clocking in at $10,000.00 for two people.](https://japandeluxetours.com/private/tour/japan-private-tour-takayama-10-days)","This is really encouraging to read. Having some free time after the tour schedule is really crucial, I think, as some of my most magical moments each time I've been to Japan have been unintended discoveries while on my way to or from something I'd planned to do. So glad y'all got to go, and that you had a good experience.

The burning question I have: what were your top 3 highlights of the trip?","> At the end of the day‚Äôs scheduled stops, the guide dropped us at the hotel and just told us when to meet him in the morning, and whatever we wanted to do until then was up to us. We also had a full free day in Tokyo    
     
I thought the idea was to keep tourists under constant observation so potential infections would be contained and traceable? If they still allow you to just wander off wherever, in a huge city like Tokyo, what's the point? lol",edge narrow flowery payment drab quicksand physical reply axiomatic gaze,"Maybe worth doing my own post. I am currently In Japan on a tourist visa. Some parts sound v similar, others a bit different in my experience. 

I had a pretty different experience applying for the tourist visa (bank statements?). We submitted way less info. Basically just an application, copy of flights, and our itinerary along with passport and the ERFS. I think that each consulate has its own procedures / requirements.

 For our consulate there was no in person application and we received the visa via the mail in 6 days. Very minimal fuss - very straight fwd. 

My wife and I did independent tours. No buses or other people. We would meet our guide at the hotel. Took trains to the sites / areas we wanted to go to. We also came up with our own itinerary. Ie - ""shopping tour of Ginza"". ""Backstreets of harajuku"" etc. 

We also had the benefit of previously spending several months of time in Japan over the years. So for a first timer, this may not be the best route....

We had every morning and evening free and like OP mentioned we were able to add/ask for some free days in between which is huge because doing a tour every single day can grind on you. I don't think people quite understand this ...you are allowed to be on your own in Japan as a tourist. Some tour companies willl permit this, others will not (because they want to charge you everyday for a guide - somewhat understandable). It's absolutely worth shopping around and finding a company that suites your wishes / needs.

We booked our own hotels via agoda and stayed in a 4 star hotel by Shibuya station for around $70 a night.

Due to the heat on some days, we asked to modify our tours and shorten them up a bit, which everyone agreed was a good idea (ie walking 6 miles in 102 heat - not the best)

The only big difference for us compared to the last times we have been to Japan is not being able to take a train to/from airport. That struck me as weird, given we were taking trains everyday during our trip. But maybe the extra $$ goes to help a driver and the tour company - so happy to help üòÄ 

My costs for two weeks with my wife were approx $1500 total. Ie $750 a person. That is cost for the tours / guide and private airport transportation. Nothing else. It would have been much less but one of our flights was via Narita and that is not a cheap taxi."
8he26n,A different way to see Japan. Last year I cycled the length of Japan. Here are my tips!,"I'd like to share my experience of travelling Japan by bicycle, and hopefully inspire others to travel the country on two wheels. Travelling like this isn‚Äôt for everyone, but I'm hoping some people find this post useful/interesting.

###Background 
I first did a bike trip in Europe in 2014. I then got a job in Tottori Prefecture, and stayed there for three years. I had an amazing time living in Japan, and decided that the best way to finish off my time in the country would be to cycle the length of it from north to south.   


###My Route 
https://imgur.com/Qq5zJsD  
The idea for this trip was to cycle to the northern point of Hokkaido (Cape Soya), then all the down to the south point of Kyushu (Cape Sata). I then took a 26 hour ferry to Okinawa and spent a week there before flying home. 

###Why a bicycle? 
There are so many great reasons to travel Japan by bike.  

- You have to get out of the cities and experience all the towns, villages and countryside in between.  
- The people are so friendly, especially in areas where they don‚Äôt often see tourists.  
- One of the main reasons I prefer to travel in this way is the flexibility - since you don‚Äôt have to book any accommodation ahead of time. I don‚Äôt enjoy planning each day in detail and searching ahead for things to do/see/eat in each place. By bicycle you can just draw a line, and see what you find along the way. If you wake up and change your mind, or get recommendations from a local, you can easily take a detour or stay another day. 
- There are also places that are hard to get to by public transport, and having your bike will solve this problem!
- In Japan it is very easy to camp for free. There are a surprising amount of free campsites, and it‚Äôs usually acceptable to camp in a quiet park or at a michi-no-eki (roadside station) if you are too far from a campsite. 
- Good roads, bike-friendly drivers, convenience stores, and the general safety of Japan also make it an easy place for your first bike trip.

###Best Memory 
I was 20km from the campsite I was aiming for, and stopped at a rural michi-no-eki (roadside station) for some water. An old man stopped to ask where I was from, then asked if I like mochi (Japanese rice cake).  
I said I did, so he told me to wait as he went to his car and gave me a bag of mochi and a bag of tomatoes.  
He (75) and his wife (80) then invited me to go to an onsen and restaurant across the road. They ordered so much food and drink, packed the leftovers for my breakfast, and they even paid for everything!  
(I set up my tent on the grassy area outside the michi-no-eki and felt quite bad for the other cyclist making some instant ramen on his stove!)

###Favourite Regions/Places

- My number one tip is to visit Hokkaido. I can‚Äôt recommend it enough. The national parks are amazing, the food is delicious, and I even saw a brown bear when cycling through Shiretoko National Park!  
This website has some good routes and information about cycling in Hokkaido - http://www.14degrees.org/hokkaido-cycle-touring-routes/

- My other favourite region for cycling was Tottori to Shimonoseki, along the San‚Äôin Coast. I highly recommend Tottori Sand Dunes and Uradome Coast near Tottori City. Mt Mitoku is an amazing hike, and Oki Islands are worth visiting.  
- Towadako and Oirase Gorge in October - The Autumn leaves were amazing!  


###When it doesn't go to plan. 
I found a box to take my bike home on the flight. But when it was packed, it was too big for the taxis in Okinawa to take it to the airport. I didn't have much time and was worried that I might miss my flight. But I finally found a solution.
https://imgur.com/NjpgRA3  


###Conclusion 
It was the best trip I‚Äôve done yet! I‚Äôll definitely be back. For anyone who enjoys nature, and is interested in seeing more than just the touristy areas, I highly recommend getting on a bike and seeing Japan in this way - whether for a few days, or a few months!  

###Some Stats: 
**Time:** 3 Months  
**Cycling Days:** 69  
**Distance Cycled:** Around 5000km  
**Prefectures:** 28  
**Highest Pass:** 1050m

efc45k,Train networks in Japan : a concept that need to understand.,"One thing I see many foreign travelers don‚Äôt understand on rail networks in Japan, despite the fact they might live in a big city and use public transportation every day, is that private railways are huge in Japan. 

First of all, JR is divided into 6 different companies (JR East, JR West and such) and the JR Pass (sold exclusively to foreign travelers) is pretty much the only ticket works on all six.


The key is JR is a just a part of public transportation in Japan.

In Tokyo, while JR has the biggest network, there are two subways companies and dozen of private railways companies.
Each and all of them have its own railroad, trains, gates, fare and stations that work INDEPENDENTLY. 

Shinjuku stations, for example, JR has its own  ‚ÄúJR Shinjuku station‚Äù.
(You can go to a station like Shibuya and Harajuku)

Right next to it, Odakyu railways (private) has its own ‚ÄúOdakyu Shinjuku station‚Äù.
(You want to take Odakyu train when you go to Hakone)

Next to it, Keio railways (private) has it own ‚ÄúKeio Shinjuku station‚Äù. (You want to take Keio if you want to go hiking at Mt. Takao)

Under ground, there are two subways companies, Tokyo Metro (private) and Toei Subway (owned by city of Tokyo). You want to take them when you go to area such as Roppongi or Asakusa.

Those stations are all connected to each other, but owned and operated by different companies.

Few blocks alway, Seibu railways (private) has ‚ÄúSeibu Shinjuku station‚Äù. 

All together, locals call  ‚ÄúShinjuku stations‚Äù.

What make navigating through the stations difficult is many of those railways companies built commercial facilities (department stores, hotels, shopping malls and such) above, around and under the station since its prime location for business. 

That‚Äôs why, Suica (a rechargeable fare card issued by JR) is revolutionary and highly recommended because it works on all transportation companies (trains, subways, buses, monorail, some taxi) in Tokyo and most transportations all over Japan.

So JR pass is a great saving if you ride expensive JR trains such as Shinkansen to go to long distance/multiple cities, but its not the best ticket to go to places within and around Tokyo since many areas aren‚Äôt accessible by JR.

Same goes to the subway pass. It‚Äôs good saving if you only use subways. 

‚ÄúUnlimited rides‚Äù sound so good but a train company only provides the information regard to their service.



Historically, private railways network is much more developed in Kansai region (Osaka, Kyoto, Kobe).

Technically, JR has been privatized (for 30 years) but still Japanese distinguish JR and private.
(Suica = issued by JR East, Pasmo = issued by private railways and bus association)

Once you understand this concept, not only using trains in Japan gets easier, but also help you plan and enjoy ‚Äúthe train culture‚Äù in Japan.",https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/efc45k/train_networks_in_japan_a_concept_that_need_to/,"Maybe I am odd, but I was in Tokyo for two weeks for work and I used a Suica card.  I loved it, it was easy to recharge plus I could expense vending expenses as travel :).  I never once saw a bus in Tokyo.","TL;DR: JR Pass good for inter-city travel. Can use at stations with ""JR"" in the name. Can use IC cards (e.g. Suica/Pasmo) at other stations, but also incl. JR","No love for Tokyu, Tobu, Keisei, Keikyu, Toden, etc.? :-(( /s",I plan to add a digital Suica card to Apple wallet before I get to Japan. If that works out then I can Apple Pay to load up more cash and it‚Äôs all simple contained in one platform. Hope it works out haha,[removed]
10nkfe0,Trip Report: General tips from a first time trip to Japan!,"Hello friends, I've just returned from a trip to Japan, made much better than it would have been by all the wonderful advice from fellow redditors. I'd like to pay it forward by writing my own trip report, but for now, here are some general tips that didn't really fit into specific days in my trip diary.  These may be more applicable to people traveling to Japan for the first time, as it was my first trip.

**Travel/Public Transport:**

If you're flying into Narita after 3pm (or any airport, really) and are planning on traveling to another area, just stay the night near the airport and travel the next day.  We landed around 4pm and went straight to Kyoto, and we were dead tired by the time we got to Kyoto at 9pm. It did save us more time, but it really wasn't worth it to try and figure out public transport while dealing with jetlag and exhaustion related with a long flight.  

It also was a pain in the ass, for some reason, to get to Narita Airport from Tokyo Bay using public transport. I'm not sure why, but we ended up transferring like 4 times and the money saved wasn't really worth it.  Next time, we'll just take the airport limo bus.

When riding on the train/subways, sometimes one line turns into another, if that makes sense? like subway line A becomes the B line. if Google Maps says ""stay on board,"" take it with a grain of salt. Sometimes it's right, sometimes it's wrong.  Try to figure out which stops the train runs to, and see if all of them match up to what Google Maps says.

However long Google Maps says it takes to get somewhere, multiply that by like 1.5-2. You don't know the area well, and that's okay! It'll be fun to explore are discover the little things along the way. Just keep that in mind if you have timed reservations anywhere.

Get the suica/ic card! It made everything way more convenient when paying for items, especially when there's a long line. I didn't realize, but the ticket machines actually show your remaining balance when you tap you way through, which is nice

**Language/Culture:**

Google Lens is the best, as everyone else says. It was so nice to be able to hold up my phone to a menu to see what it says rather than just struggle.

3 words: Sumimasen. Daijoubu. Arigato. You should probably know these three at a minimum before you go.  I know a few other phrases, but these were so applicable to nearly every situation. 

Someone said Google Translate is better for Japanese to English translations, and DeepL is better for English to Japanese. I'm not sure if that's true, but it was easier to have two apps so I didn't have to switch the language back and forth. Also, I highly recommend downloading Japanese on Google Translate, it'll still work even if you don't have internet access.

This is small, but I brought some small American candies to gift to people who were exceptionally helpful or kind.  Tips aren't accepted, and non-edible items are dust bunnies, but everyone likes to try snacks from around the world. So I tossed 12-15 individually-wrapped fun-sized candies and packets of jelly beans into my suitcase to give away. They were accepted and much appreciated.

Bring a washcloth to dry your hands after using the restroom, as paper towels are not provided, and try to store it in an outside pouch of your bag or an otherwise easily accessible place. 

**Misc:**

We were previously undecided on going to Tokyo Disneyland, as we live close enough to American Disneyland in California.  However, being moderate Disney fans, and seeing how cheap the prices were compared to the awful gouging American prices, we opted to go to both Tokyo Disney Resorts. For some reason, the online Tokyo Disney Resort website decided it didn't like the mastercard we had gotten specifically to buy Disney tickets even though it had worked for purchasing Disney Sea tickets a month prior, so we ended up having to use Klook. Anyways, Just a PSA. Try to get the tickets sorted out before you go.

Bring some medication from home. This is kinda gross, but it took me 2 days to adjust to the food, and I absolutely shit my brains out the first night. Sure, I bet conbini sells some weird ass weak Japanese pepto, but who wants to run out into the streets at night and try to translate shit to some guy at 3am while battling stomach pain and the shits? not me! 

Departments stores are very reliable for good food! They're usually close to big stations and were great to visit in a pinch when we wanted to get food on the way back to our accommodations. 

Don't bring a hairdryer, all our accommodations had one. Hostels may be different, idk

Even very old inns and hotels are very clean.

To save on luggage space, I only packed 2 sets of clothes in addition to what I wore on the plane. Many hotels/inns have coin laundry, or it's just down the street. Worst comes to worst, the bathroom sink/bathtub. I would normally do my laundry in the evening. Get back from sightseeing, toss a load of laundry in, shower, and then grab the laundry and throw it in the drier. Eat dessert, brush my teeth, plan out the next day, and the clothes are dry before bedtime. If they aren't, they can dry in the room overnight+the next day, or I can throw them in the drier before getting breakfast at conbini. 

This seems obvious, but try to group your activities by location. It's easier to travel in one direction then to run around all over the place.

Don't be gross, wear a fucking mask.",https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/10nkfe0/trip_report_general_tips_from_a_first_time_trip/,"Yes, some lines can turn into a different line even from a completely different company. Many of the Tokyo Metro lines continue and turn into various trains. That is what they call thru service. So yes it is absolutely possible that you have to stay in the train and it will just continue on a different line.

Hostel also usually have hair dryer.

I agree with doing laundry, but I would keep more like 4 changes. Only 2 mean you have to do it really frequently.",">but it took me 2 days to adjust to the food, and I absolutely shit my brains out the first night. 

What did you eat? As someone with a somewhat sensitive stomach (mild lactose intolerance), I didn't have any issues in Japan. They don't seem to use a lot of dairy in their food,which I appreciate.

>Bring a washcloth to dry your hands after using the restroom

Yeah, I did a lot of wiping on my pants which was not exactly ideal. A few places did have hand dryers but they were almost always closed presumably for Covid reasons. 

>When riding on the train/subways, sometimes one line turns into another, if that makes sense?

Yeah I ran into this confusion as well, trying to take the train from Tokyo to the Makuhari Messe in Chiba for a concert. Accidentally got off the train when I shouldn't have, wasting about 10-15 minutes until the next train came. And of course, the next train was a local train, not an express like the one I got off from, adding even more time. Thankfully, I still got to the venue well in time, but it did makes things
a bit more interesting than it should have been.","> This is small, but I brought some small American candies to gift to people who were exceptionally helpful or kind.

11jg3fz,Just came back from Japan last week and I want to share my itinerary/thoughts.,"As the title says, I recently returned from Japan and I had the time of my life. Everything from the food, culture, Japanese people's politeness and the craziness of Tokyo...It was an absolute blast. Super keen on getting back out there again for longer. I'll definitely be more well prepared to make journey much smoother, which I'll go into more detail below. I spend 11 days in total in Japan which was spread across Tokyo, Osaka and Kyoto. I also travelled solo.

**Airport**

Regardless of what airport you fly into, you'll want to take the public trains into Tokyo. Taxi's are notooriously expensive in Japan and should only be used in emergencies. This is assuming you are on a budget, otherwise go crazy.

If you can, I highly advise you to fly into Haneda as it'll make your journey much shorter and easier to get to Tokyo. Narita is nowhere near Tokyo and you'll have to take a long train journey to Tokyo station most likely which is a pain to navigate even without being jetlagged.

**On Arrival At Airport**

So there are a couple of things you want to do when you touch down. Buy a Sim Card and get a Pasmo/Suica card.

* So I tried to cut costs and buy a sim card once I got closer to my accomodation. Although it saved me money, it was a pain getting to my accomodation relying on free wifi and directions I prepared before my flight. I would say buy a sim card at the airport. Make sure your phone is unlocked.
* The other thing you'll want to do is get a pasmo/suica card. Not sure the difference between the two but the method is more or less the same. Load the card up with money and you can use that for travel, vending machines etc. Trust me it'll save so much time and hassle!
* The other thing I'll reccomend is taking out a lot of cash. If you're buying the Pasmo/Suica card I believe you'll have to have physical cash to load them up. I'll say take out around $200 worth for now. Although a lot of places in Tokyo accept card, the country is still a cash based society so you'll almost certainly come across establishments that only take cash.

**Commuting**

Unless you are willing to blow a ton of money during your trip, you will be depending on public transport during your trip. In all three cities I visitied, I was using public transport several times a day. There is also the Shinkansen to get from Tokyo to the Kansai region (Osaka, Kyoto). It's great and an activity within itself.

**Other notes**

Yeah so Japan's culture is different from the west. So try your best to assimiliate, look up videos on Youtube on what to expect and do. Learn some Japanese as well. These aren't a must but you don't want to look like a\*\*hole. Sooner you start the better.

**Itinerary**

Day 1: Arrived in Tokyo and settled in. Stayed in Shinjuku. Walked around Shinjuku, avoided the scammers in Shinjuku (wasted some of their time by having pointless conversations). Had some ramen and hung out with fellow solo travellers in Golden Gai.

Day 2: Checked out Tsukiji Market for some delicious fresh seafood. Ventured off to Akihabara to check out the nerd culture and play some games. Ended the night in Golden Gai before going to a batting cage.

Day 3: Visited Asakusa for temples and shopping in the area. Went to Shibuya in the evening to check out the crossing and ate some sushi from a conveyer belt resturaunt. Had a nap before heading to Roppongi for a bar crawl. Ended up in Shibuya again for an Izakaya (specialised in chicken skin) and nightclub (Womb).

Day 4: Woke up late from being exhausted from the previous night. Checked out Ikebukuro for sunshine city. Had Wagyu beef for dinner in Akihabara.

Day 5: Checked out Teamlab Planets (very cool). Wandered around Shinjuku some more (Don Quiote store is fun) before going to an anime themed bar in Nakano. Ended the night at an Izakaya in Shinjuku, Karaoke and nightclub (Warp).

Day 6: Slept in for a bit before heading to the Shinkansen to Osaka. Got myself a bento box for the journey. On arrival in Osaka I checked into my hostel around Namba area and I had curry at a buffalo curry place (forgot the name). Explored Dottonbori for a bit and tried some street food.

Day 7: Went to Universal Studios Japan. Such a fun experience but the food was poor. If you go buy the express pass as it will save time. Went back to Namba area after for some Shabu-shabu (hot pot) before going to a karaoke and club (Giraffe).

Day 8: Took it easy and checked out Osaka castle. Had some more food in the Dottonbori area before going to a bar to chillout. Had an early night for the next day.

Day 9: Day trip to Kyoto. That's right I only did a day trip. However, I managed to check out a lot of the main sights (Fushimi-Inari, Ginkaku-Ji, Gion, Arashiyama). It was very crowded so had to depend on a taxi to get to Kyoto station. Ended the day with some drinks at a bar and went to Giraffe club again.

Day 10: Train back to Tokyo. Grabbed another bento box. Stayed in the Roppongi area which is a rather bougie area. Relaxed at an Onsen (public bathhouse) which was uncomfortable until you get in the bath. Highly reccomend. Had some Sushi before heading to bed.

Day 11: Last day in Japan. My flight wasn't until late night so spent the day checking out Ueno and doing some shopping (lot's of snacks). Ate as much food as possible before getting the Narita express to the airport.

&#x200B;

So there you have it. I feel like I did a decent amount whilst leaving enough time to just explore and not feel pressured to stick to a plan. Honestly, there is a ton of stuff to do in Japan and some of my favourite nights were when I just had an open mind. My favourite areas in Tokyo were Tsukiji Market, Shinjuku and Shibuya. I reccomend staying in the Shinjuku area if you are into nightlife and good food. Otherwise, check out Asakusa which is more chill but has tons to do. For Osaka, I would say stay in the Namba area if you are into nightlife.

Overall, Japan was a blast with so many cool things such as vending machines (which actually work), their obsession with Gatcha toys and the variety of foods they have on offer. I definitely want to check out this amazing country again.",https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/11jg3fz/just_came_back_from_japan_last_week_and_i_want_to/,I just wanted to call out for anyone reading this post that if you‚Äôre staying in Shinjuku and flying into Narita then you can simply take the Narita Express without any need for a transfer.

c4jq9q,Beware of help in train stations,"This literally just happened and I wanted to make sure people would be more aware and less dumb then I was! 

So today I was at Shinjuku station with my sister waiting in line to top up( charge ) my card. As I was waiting I was approached by a middle age / old man . He kept asking where i was going and I have no japanese. I tried to tell him I was ok and that I was just waiting to top up my card. My sister stood off to the side looking up things in her phone.

When a charge station became available he ran to it and ushered me to it. I was like I'm ok its fine I know how to do this thanks. Most of the time people are just trying to help. I always look Abit like a deer in headlights. Unfortunately it is my natural face so I thought he was concerned that I was lost. 

After toping up my card he demanded for my change. I was holding my purse at the time with my license in it and my bank card so I was terrified he would take it. I have a disability and would not be able to run after him if he did. He was extremely forceful, took the change  and he ran.

Normally people are so nice and helpful in the stations but just beware as some are there to get money off you.",https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/c4jq9q/beware_of_help_in_train_stations/,"I‚Äôm sorry this happened to you, but in the future, be sure to say NO! loudly and forcefully. It‚Äôs very possible you were trying to be too polite, and saying ‚ÄúOk‚Äù (confusing, could be interpreted as ‚ÄúOk, please help me‚Äù) didn‚Äôt help. 

If you‚Äôre ever uncomfortable or being harassed, it‚Äôs perfectly acceptable to drop all the nonsense about ‚Äúyou must be polite in Japan‚Äù to throw a scammer off. Stand your ground. I‚Äôve walked away from so many scammers without so much as a ‚Äúgomen.‚Äù They‚Äôre  scammers and don‚Äôt deserve your politeness. 

‚ÄúNO‚Äù is universal in any language. It would also help attract attention if the guy did still end up being pushy with you.","My colleague told me about this scam and I didn‚Äôt quite understand it. Turns out there‚Äôs nothing complicated about it, they just flat out rob you!","This happened to me in Shinjuku station too, second visit to Japan and the first time I had people offer to help me with no expectations for a reward in Shibuya station so I just thought the guy was being polite, he led us to the JR counter and then asked for money when we got there, it was really uncomfortable. I gave him 500 yen. He was probably 50-60, I wonder if it was the same guy. Oh well, lesson learned. Probably taking advantage of foreigner‚Äôs stereotype of Japanese people all being so ‚Äòpolite and eager to help‚Äô.","The same happened to me actually, same location, and the guy sounded similar. I offered to take him to get food and he just got really upset, demanded money, eventually left me alone.","People always like to be ‚ÄúJapan is so nice, people will help you with anything! I was lost and kind stranger helped me! Amazing!‚Äù

Yeah no, if you need help seek out station staff, it‚Äôs what they‚Äôre there for, trust me. They also usually have some capacity to help deal with foreign tourist especially in Tokyo or other heavy tourist areas. 

Also, you‚Äôre more safer ASKING for help than having a stranger butt their way into your problem. If you ask someone for directions and they go the extra mile, that‚Äôs cool. But if someone is being persistent by injecting themselves into the situation regardless of if you asked or not, that‚Äôs not cool. Just remember what you‚Äôre uncomfortable with in your culture, isn‚Äôt much different in Japan either. He was being a harassing scam artist and you‚Äôre completely allowed to call him out on it. Most of us who live here have learned to ignore everything and I mean EVERYTHING. It‚Äôs usually the tourist who try to play polite in Japan when it‚Äôs not a situation that warrents being polite.

Sorry you experienced that."
e319my,Thank You For A Life Changing Experience,"This will get lost in New but I really wanted to take the time and thank everyone on this sub that helped me out when I had questions, and thank you to Japan for being an utmost gracious, loving, and life changing host.

I grew up very poor, dysfunctional and abusive parents, and surrounded by bad environments and horrible influences. I have been working myself to death these past four years straight, and at the age of 25 I decided to finally take the leap and travel overseas for the very first time, to Japan for two weeks. I had always adored the Japanese culture, mythology, religion, architecture, pop culture, influences, society, it all looked so amazing, and I mean this with utmost sincerity, Japan exceeded every single one of my expectations.

I have been dealing with depression since early high school and have been extremely suicidal the past 6 months again, even started seeing a therapist which was a big deal to me. This trip, my very first time overseas, has singlehandedly given love to my heart and has made me want to continue on and ensure I find a way to do so. I'm currently writing this as I tear up happily, my emotions are all over the place, as I am preparing to leave for the airport later today to go back home in Australia.

Words cannot express my gratitude to the people of Japan, despite me only knowing very few words of Japanese each and everyone of you made me feel welcome. I never once felt like I was a burden, or unwelcom. This made me want to explore more and more, fall depper in love with my surroundings, as it had been forever since I genuinely loved what surrounded me.

I will never forget my first proper day in Japan, as I was heading to the Akihabara station to head home, I came across a busker known as Small Samurai, who was an absolutely beautiful violinist. No one knew, but I absolutely adore the violin, it makes me feel those deep emotions that most music can't, and to watch and listen to him play beautifully as it became dusk, I couldn't help but feel like I was in a state of pure bliss. I thanked him and made sure to gift him money for performing. Just something about seeing such a performance live all by chance on my first day in Japan, made me feel like a higher power really wanted me to be happy, and now I know how truly happy I can be I will strive to keep that feeling alive within myself.

This likely sounds rather generic and unimportant, but I really just wanted to tell someone how much my life has been changed by coming to Japan. Despite the trip being a short one and the fact I'm leaving for my flight home today, I will never forget my time here and will always keep my sentimental memories with me.

This trip saved my life, it has made me realise that I do deserve to be happy and I will try my hardest to stay happy.

dpemc2,Shuri Castle (Okinawa) has burned down,"A fire broke out overnight at Shuri Castle in Okinawa, a World Heritage Site. Unfortunately the reports on Japanese media this morning are saying that the castle is completely gone. No reports on the fire source so far.

# Background

I'm 24M and I traveled alone. I stayed in an apartment in Sumida-ku in Tokyo for \~2 months - January and February. I also traveled to Fujikawaguchiko, Kamakura & Enoshima, Yokohama, Kanazawa, Shirakawago, Takayama, Sapporo, Kyoto and Osaka (in that order). I decided to skip Nikko, Hakone and Nara, all of which I'd already been to in the autumn.

I divided my trip into two halves. For the first part, I stayed in Tokyo with no excursions. I wanted to experience the city more like a local. I didn‚Äôt plan much in advance and tried to save money wherever I could. The second half was the complete opposite - I traveled all over Japan: Kanto, Chubu, Hokkaido, and Kansai. I booked accommodations in advance and meticulously planned every itinerary. This part was definitely pricier than my time in Tokyo.

# 1. Tokyo's Subway System

I used Tokyo‚Äôs subway system every single day, multiple times a day. I became so familiar with it that I stopped using Google Maps most of the time (okay, sometimes). I could go on for hours about how efficient and impressive the system is (and I may or may not have consequently purchased a picture of Tokyo's subway map to hang on my bedroom's wall), but here are a few important things I learned:

1a) **Underground Connectivity**: Some stations in Tokyo are not fully connected underground. In many cases, you would have to go above ground to the street to transfer to another line. This is almost always true when transferring between JR lines and subway lines; but it's sometimes true even when both lines are subway lines. The exit (or entrance) you go through is also crucial.

1b) **Subway Path Optimization:** Google Maps usually does a good job, but it doesn‚Äôt always give you the most efficient route. For example, it sometimes assumes you walk at an average pace, so you might not make it in time for your transfer. More importantly, if you're using an unlimited metro pass, it's better to take two subway lines (which would be free) than a single JR line (which would cost extra). The subway map is pretty easy to read, so you can figure it out on your own.

1c) **General Etiquette**: On escalators, stand on the left. If you must walk, do it on the right side, but ideally avoid it altogether. During rush hour, people might walk on both sides. On platforms, stand behind the yellow/white lines and always let people get off the train first before you board. Keep your backpack in front of you, and try to hug it tightly. If it's crowded on the train and you're standing by the door, step outside briefly to let people off, then go back on. And please avoid talking, eating, or littering on the train.

# 2. Winter in Japan

I come from a hot country where it almost never drops below 15¬∞C (60¬∞F), let alone snow, and I had never traveled in the winter before. I'd been worried and anxious about too many things: What would I wear? What if I'm too sensitive to the cold? How do I deal with snow? Etc.

I came prepared: I wore two layers + a down jacket, warm socks, a beanie, a scarf and gloves. I went to Uniqlo on my very first day in Japan and bought (thermal) Heat-Tech undershirt & underpants. I also bought quite expensive snow boots. And yet, on the first two days I was **freezing**, yes even during the day. I actually suffered, to the point that I was actually considering going back home (such a drama queen...). And the funny thing is, it was merely around 6¬∞C (43¬∞F) during the day.

But the good news is - I'm here to tell you that your body most definitely adjusts. After just a few days, I stopped wearing my warm socks, gloves, beanie and scarf, and during the day I didn't even have my coat on. The temperatures in Takayama, Shirakawago and Sapporo were much lower: around -2¬∞C (28¬∞F) during the day and -6¬∞C (21¬∞F) at nights & early mornings, and I wore the same stuff. I've actually never used the Heat Tech stuff I bought from Uniqlo.

That said, there were still particularly cold days, so here are some tips for dealing with winter in Japan:

2a) **Heat Packs (Kairo)**: You can buy these in department stores and conbinis (I got mine at Matsumoto Kiyoshi). They stay warm for hours and are a lifesaver on chilly days. Just shake them a few times to get them going, and trust me, warm hands feel amazing.

2b) **Hot Drinks**: Do yourself a favor and buy a bottle of hot cocoa from any vending machine (or conbini) in the morning. It can serve as a short-lasting kairo, and you also feel quite nice and warm after drinking it (oh, and it's tasty!).

2c) **Neck Gaiters**: I absolutely hated my scarf. It was itchy and it didn't actually make me feel warm. So I bought a neck gaiter from Amazon - it worked wonders. Out of all the winter gear that I got, this was definitely the best piece.

2d) **Do NOT Underestimate Ground Ice**: I very stupidly forgot my snow boots in Tokyo when I went to Chubu and it was bad. I can proudly say that I've never actually slipped\*, but I was *very* close to that *many, many* times. I was extra cautious because of that and walked super slowly. The ice on the ground (that looks like snow, actually) is incredibly slippery and dangerous. Get boots with a good grip, not just for the sake of warmth, but to protect yourself from falling.

^(\*Update: writing this from Sapporo, I did actually slip. Twice.)

2e) **Wear Layers**: Places indoors are usually heated, especially the suwbay stations (and the train itself, of course). Trust me, you do not want to stand there squished between dozens of people with your heavy coat on. Make sure you wear layers that you can always take off when you feel too hot.

2f) **Dryness**: The winter in Japan is very dry, so expect your skin, eyes, etc to get dry. To be honest, I don't really know how to deal with that, I just dealt with the effects. Use the proper skin products and maybe get some eye drops.

2g) **Sunsets**: The skies in Tokyo never seemed to have a single cloud. They were clear, bright and gorgeous throughout the entire time I was there (which is not a novelty in the winter in Tokyo). I have stunning & unfiltered pictures of sunsets that I took that could definitely be the best pictures I took the entire trip. I found the sunsets to be most beautiful at Odaiba for obvious reasons.

2h) **Global Warming**: Due to global warming, the winter is shorter, and most importantly, there's much less snow. I talked to an old man in Kanazawa who's lived there his entire life and he told me that they see less and less snow every year. Global warming also means that blossoms occur earlier - both cherry (Sakura) and more importantly (since it's a late winter blossom) the Japanese plum 'Ume'.

2i) **Greenery**: Take into consideration that most trees are bare and gardens are just generally grayer. I think they're beautiful either way.

P.S. - I had an umbrella in my backpack during the entire trip and I've never used it, not even once. It's not a coincidence since the winter is the driest season in Japan (in my country it's the wettest), but even when it rained on some days, my coat's hood did the trick.

# 3. Low Season

I visited Japan in October last year, during the high season. It was very touristy because of the nice weather, Halloween-themed spots, and beautiful autumn leaves. This time, I visited in winter, which is considered the low season. January, in particular, is the least touristy month of the year.

I most certainly felt and enjoyed that difference. I can safely say that the number of tourists from October *at least* doubled the number of tourists I saw this winter. It was much easier to get reservations to restaurants and attractions, and the streets felt calmer overall.

I will say that quite abruptly, on February 1st, I felt like the crowds doubled in size, and it stayed that way through February. It's not a surprise, since February is warmer and generally prettier than January (in Tokyo, at least). And don't get me wrong though. Tokyo was crowded. It always is. Especially on the weekends. It's just that it's *less* crowded than the rest of the year.

**Should I travel in Japan's off-season**? Absolutely yes, if you have the time. I would only suggest to avoid it if you really, *really* hate the cold.

# 4. Favorites

In this fun little section, I will share some of my *personal* favorites. Honestly this section is just for fun, since things like ""favorite metro line"" might not be very useful, but who knows.

4a) **Train Line in Tokyo**

**Best - Toei Oedo (E)**: The Toei Oedo Line was definitely my favorite line in Tokyo. Similar to the Yamanote Line, it forms a loop around the city, but it actually extends further east and west, and it is so much less crowded. It goes through Ueno (-okachimachi), Tsukishima (connects you to Odaiba), Tsukijishijo, Roppongi, Yoyogi, Tochomae (for the Government Building *free* observation deck & lightshows), Nakano (Higashi-), Shinjuku (east *and* west) and Kasuga (for Tokyo Dome & Korakuen Gardens). I used it almost every day.

**Worst - JR Yamanote Line (JY)**: This is arguably the most well-known line in Tokyo to tourists since it goes through some of the biggest & most relevant stations in Tokyo, having a nice loop structure. For this reason, it is *extremely* crowded, almost at every hour of the day. There's almost certainly a better path to your destination, I guarantee it. I also personally feel like the JR stations are much more hectic and confusing compared to the metro stations.

4b) **Garden/Park**

I am an avid lover of Japanese gardens and parks. According to my list, I've been to more than 30 gardens/parks in Japan. Personally, I think what makes a garden the best is - (1) small crowds, (2) a giant lake (preferrably in the center), (3) a mostly one-way path, and (4) seasonal species (like winter flowers, cherry/plum/ginkgo trees, etc; especially trees that wouldn't be bare in the winter). With this in mind, the award goes to:

**Best - Heian Jingu Shrine Garden in Kyoto**: I kinda hate sharing this because I do *not* want this garden to become popular, but I also hate gatekeeping (quite literally!). The shrine in Kyoto is fairly popular, but a lot of people skip the garden (which costs a fee, unlike the entrance to the temple that is free of charge). The garden is huge, beautiful, clean, colorful, and most importantly, much less crowded than others (at least when I visited it, and I did so twice).

4c) **Food**

I ate *a lot*. I tried so many things to the point that I don't think I can name a single thing that I didn't try (did someone say a sea snail?). I went to Michelin rated restaurants, food stalls, small corner shops, fast-food chains, diners, conveyor-belt sushi chains (several!), etc. Also, my country doesn't have the typical American fast-food chains (except for McDonald's), so I was quite excited to try them all for the first time as well.

**Best Ramen**: Definitely goes to **Ippudo**. Very basic but easily beats every single of of the 8 other ramen places I tried. My favorite is the winter-special miso ramen (Yummmmm!). And yes, I liked it more than Ichiran.

**Best Conveyor-Belt Sushi**: Personally I think **Kura Sushi** is much better than Sushiro (Extra points for Bikkurapon!).

**Best Michelin Rated**: **Sumiyaki Sousai Toriya Hitomi** in Kyoto has got to have the best Yakitori I've ever tried. It also appeared on the NYT like a decade ago. I went there three times.

**Best Fine Dining**: **Tapas Molecular Bar** in Tokyo was such a wonderful and fun experience. It is *not* just eating, trust me. The food was absolutely incredible. Very expensive though.

**Best Seafood**: I don't remember the place's name but it was in Sapporo. Generally, **Hokkaido** is the best place for seafood. I had the best seafood there.

**Best Fastfood**: Weirdly I liked **Wendy's** best.

4d) **View of Mount Fuji**

The **northern side** looks better than the southern side, in my opinion, but I would still recommend to see them both. The northern side is usually observed from Fujikawaguchiko (absolutely do *not* miss), and the southern side is usually observed from Hakone. With that being said, the award for best spot to view Mount Fuji most certainly goes to **Fujikawaguchiko**.

# 5. Personal Experiences

In this section, I would like to share some personal experiences - some are good, and some are bad. It's important to say that for every bad experience I had, there were about a dozen good ones.

5a) **Getting Wet in USJ**: I had gone on the Jurassic Park - The Ride a total of 4 times before this one, so I knew exactly what to expect. However, for some reason, while the entire boat and the people on it seemed to be quite dry, I was soaking wet, head to toe, including my glasses, which were completely covered in water. It wasn't too long until I realized everybody looked at me and laughed. I was kinda embarrassed.

I got off the boat and went to a corner to dry off. Shortly after, I was approached by a young couple that offered me tissue papers (it seems like they'd gone somewhere to get them). It's amazing to me how such a simple act of kindness and thoughtfulness made me feel so nice, almost as if I was glad to have become wet in the first place.

And if that's not enough, I was approached by them later *again*, this time with a freaking hot chocolate drink. I was speechless. I love the Japanese people.

5b) **Getting Invited to a Table in a Restaurant**: One evening I went to eat out at a diner. A young Japanese couple saw me sitting alone and invited me to sit with them. Their excuse was that it was much more worth it for me to share meals with them rather than pay alone. They both knew English but the woman couldn't speak it (only understand), but I luckily did understand her Japanese (at times). It was the funniest, most heartwarming evening I had in Japan. I was really moved because for the first time I wasn't alone. After more than a month of eating alone it was really exciting to sit with people, share meals, and socialize. I sometimes felt like a ghost in Japan, and this was the first time I felt seen.

5c) **Getting Invited to a Locals' Home**: On the plane to Kanazawa (KMQ) from Tokyo, I sat next to a Japanese couple (I'd say \~45 years old). I practiced my Japanese Kanji using a website where you're given the various English meanings of a character, and then asked to draw it. The couple saw it and got pretty excited, complimenting me and saying how my writing skills are better than theirs (surely an exaggeration and just a way to be nice lol).

It made me feel really nice, since I'd done this *everywhere* (queuing, on trains, etc) and I had always hoped someone would notice and say something (it was kind of my personal way to invite people around me to talk to me). I'm very shy and I always want to talk to locals, but I never want to interrupt their private lives, especially given that they might not know English, so I would never approach anyone directly.

It was my first time talking to locals, also for actually quite a while (we stayed on the plane and kept talking, purposefully being the last ones to walk out to prolong the conversation as much as possible, without delaying the airline crew, of course). They even invited me to their home in Ibaraki and we exchanged numbers.

5d) **Going to the Cinema**: I went to the cinema in Tokyo twice, both times at the same place (Toho in Midtown Hibiya). The experiences were incredible. The Japanese people are super respectful - there wasn't a single sound throughout the entire movie, no one used their smartphones (even to just look at the time - so you never see a flash of a bright screen), and they even stayed seated throughout the credits out of respect (no, there wasn't a post-credits scene). The screen was also gigantic (I-MAX Laser) and the spatial sound was extremely high quality. I highly recommend going if your cinemas at home are lame (like mine).

5e) **Locals Staring**: From the moment I arrived in Japan to the moment I left, I was stared by the locals every single day. Sometimes in trains, sometimes in restaurants, sometimes on the street. I don't know why. I don't think I'm especially ugly or handsome, I (hopefully!) don't have a weird gait or posture, and I'm pretty sure I've never done anything rude or disrespectful. Yes I look like a tourist, but Tokyo (at least) sees thousands of them every day. The only thing I can think of is that I was a man and alone (I guess being in a group is more common and less weird). I have to say, I was quite uncomfortable with the staring sometimes, and it made me super self-aware.

5f) **Insulting Exchange with a Vendor**: Before telling this story, I'll start by saying that I've always known how physical touch is something that is usually avoided in public in Japan. For this reason, from the get-go, I always did my absolute best to avoid touching anyone. Specifically, when it comes to handing out coins, I always did my best to release the coins from my palm *above* the palm of the receiver, rather than hand them out normally (which usually results in the palms briefly touching).

One time I went to a Chinese restaurant in Akasaka. When I had to pay the bill, I gave the vendor some coins, and accidentally, my finger touched the vendor's palm, in the most normal, natural way possible (not rubbing or any weirdness of some sort, it was very brief and normal). I didn't react or say anything because that's such a normal thing to happen, but what followed was quite insulting: the vendor made a disgusted face followed by a verbal ""blegh"" *in front of my face*. She then used the hand sanitizer, looked at the chef and physically shivered while laughing.

I have to say that I was quite offended. I'm a very clean and hygienic person, I don't smell, and my hands were definitely not dirty. And even if I had some food crumbs on my palm (WHICH I DID NOT), I don't know why she thought it was okay to do that in front of my face. It's very rude towards anybody but especially to a paying customer.

I am pretty confident the reason was racism.

^(\*The vendor wasn't Japanese.)

5g) **Traveling Alone**: Japan is amazing for solo-travelers. I don't know how to explain it, but this place has its way to make you feel less alone, even when you are. It's a normal sight to see people eating alone at restaurants, taking pictures of themselves, etc. This wasn't my first time traveling alone, but it was certainly the longest one, so I did find the experience quite isolating at times. I guess the hardest part for me was getting pictures. Sometimes I found myself standing in the same spot for more than an hour (longest was two hours!), waiting for the right person to take a picture of me.\*

^(\*Some of my inner thoughts: Women - no, I'm a man, it could be intimidating to them; Old fellas - no, they might not know how to operate the phone; Couples/groups - no, I wouldn't want to interrupt and make the others wait; Locals - no, they're probably busy with their work and life; Tourists - no, they're holding bags and cameras, I don't want them to leave their items on the floor because of me... Etc etc.)

# 6. Rude Tourists

In this section I'm going to share some of the rude things I saw tourists do. Please, by all means, do not act like these ones. I am not going to mention race or nationality, but I will make the distinction between locals and tourists.

6a) **Picture in Warner Bros Studios**: There's almost always a long line next to the Hogwarts Express where people take pictures next to. After someone finished taking their pictures, I was shocked to see a young couple of tourists *that hadn't stood in line at all* quickly running in (before the next group in line had the chance) to take their pictures. The next group in line (seemed to be locals) seemed a bit shocked and obviously just waited. When the rude couple finished, the group in line finally walked forward, only to be interrupted *by the same couple* yet again to take an extra picture or two. This time the group actually walked away to let the couple finish taking their pictures (as if they'd needed to...).

**What to do instead?** Don't cut in line. Simple as that.

6b) **Bus to Shirakawago**: I was unlucky enough to book a ticket on a bus from Kanazawa to Shirakawago that was filled with a large group of tourists of the same nationality (different than mine). It seemed to be just me, another young couple (also tourists, different nationality), and them. They were 46, but the driver insisted that he only received 43 tickets. The leader of the group was probably the rudest person I saw on this entire trip. He was loud, inappropriately touchy (kept touching the bus driver, taking papers from his hands, etc), and even on some point blocked the way of one of the staff members that came to help. He kept speaking loudly in broken English, sometimes turning around to his group talking to them in their native language *while laughing* (?!). The bus was delayed by 20 (!) minutes because of them. The bus driver just gave up but he seemed very angry, rightfully so (I don't think I'd ever seen a Japanese staff member angry before this, and that says a lot).

**What to do instead?** Make sure you have every single ticket before you embark on the bus. Don't be unnecessarily loud. DON'T TOUCH STRANGERS, let alone staff members. Use Google Translate and make efforts to speak the local language (especially if your English is unintelligible). And in general, have some respect to personal space.

6c) **Physical Fight in Yokohama China Town**: There was a group of three loud guys (tourists) standing next to a stall in Yokohama's China Town. The Japanese guy working at the stall asked them to move back to make space for the queuing people. The tourists ignored him and did not move back. The Japanese worker approached them again, this time he sounded more impatient. The tourists got upset and one of them *physically shoved the worker*. The worker then retaliated, and what followed was a brief but quite heated exchange of pushing and screaming.

**What to do instead?** Do not stand in a space designated for standing in line. Also, if not very obvious, DON'T RAISE YOUR HANDS at anybody. It is literally against the law.

# 7. Random Tips

7a) **Flight from Tokyo to Kansai (Kyoto/Osaka)**: *The* most gorgeous, breathtaking view I had in this entire trip was Mount Fuji, in its glory, surrounded by the clearest blue skies, from a rather low-altitude plane from NRT to KIX. The plane is *so* close to the mountain, it's crazy. It looked huge and majestic, almost too surreal. I gasped vocally. Numerous times. If you've already traveled this route by Shinkansen, I highly recommend a domestic flight for a different perspective (more on domestic flights on \[7b\]).

7b) **Domestic Flights**: To save money as much as possible, I had decided to travel around Japan with domestic flights, since they *looked* much cheaper & faster than the Shinkansen. What actually happened is that they ended up costing just as much and actually lasting longer than the Shinkansens. This is because luggage can be expensive (on some airlines), and the trip from the center of the city to the airport (and back) is not only long but also costly. And of course, you have to be at the airport \~1-2 hours before boarding. I'd recommend domestic flights only if you pack light, and if the route is interesting (see \[7a\]).

7c) ¬•**100 Coins**: One of the best tips I could share here is to always have some ¬•100 coins on you. You need them for coin lockers (not all places have change machines), and also for some buses. I learned this the hard way - I went on a bus one time in Kanazawa that did not accept IC cards. I only had one ¬•100 coin a bill of ¬•5000 on me; but the automatic change machine on the bus could only accept ¬•1000 bills. The bus driver was nice enough to accept the only coin I had (which is half the cost) but I don't know what would other drivers do.

7d) **Buses Always Stop**: I'm going to be careful here and say that this is not always the case, but during 3 months all over Japan, I went on plenty of buses, and can safely say that it was *generally* the case - The buses in Japan would always stop at the station *and* open the door for a few seconds, yes even if nobody pressed the 'stop' button, and yes even if the station is empty. I find this lovely and comforting, and I'm sharing it as a tip, since this generally means that you don't have to stand under the pouring rain next to the sidewalk for the bus driver to see you. They would stop at the station regardless, so you can wait under a nearby roof before approaching the station.

7e) **Fold the Napkin**: Sometimes in restaurants you would get a warm towel or a soft napkin. From what I've observed, locals seem to fold them neatly after they're done with them (upon research, apparently for extra uses). I began doing the same at some point and I could swear that waiters noticed it and smiled at me for it. It‚Äôs a small but thoughtful gesture, and it shows that you‚Äôre paying attention to local customs.

# 8. Final Thoughts & A Personal Note

On my last night, I stood in Shibuya's Scramble Crossing, for 3 hours straight, until the very last train at midnight. I didn't do anything - I didn't eat, or drink, or even cross the streets. I just stood there in awe, watching the neon lights, people walking, talking, taking pictures and smiling. Amazingly, the neon signs showed some pictures and videos of temples in Kyoto, snow in Hokkaido, the huts in Shirakawago, etc; so in a way, I felt like I was watching a recap of the entire trip I'd had. I was obviously bawling for an hour straight.

The last year was the hardest year of my life. After getting kicked out of my home (and dozens of other experiences) I really felt like I didn't belong anywhere, and that I didn't have a home.

**Tokyo was a home for me in a time where no other place was,** and for that, it will always have a special place in my heart. With its energy, its kindness, and its beauty, it was a place where I found peace and solace when nothing else made sense. The kindness of the people I met there, the politeness, and the respect ‚Äì these will always stay with me. I'm thankful for having this experience, the free time to do it, the financial ability to make it happen, and most importantly, for the wonderful, absolute best people in the world - the Japanese. My deepest wish is to one day return to Japan and live there again, maybe more permanently.

\#Tokyo

\- **Sutamina-En ( Yakiniku)** [https://tabelog.com/en/tokyo/A1323/A132305/13003777/](https://tabelog.com/en/tokyo/A1323/A132305/13003777/)

Tabelog award silver 2017, gold 2018, silver 2019. It is not the easiest of places to get to. I suggest a taxi straight from the train station and be there at 4pm although it opens at 6pm. Yes 4pm, you read that right. The line gets really long quickly and if you do not get into the first seating you are gonna have a long wait (about 2hours plus).

Food pics - [https://imgur.com/a/5AY3EnM](https://imgur.com/a/5AY3EnM)

The lady boss is extremely friendly for those that can speak chinese, shes from Taiwan. She took really,really good care of us ie gave us extra side dishes, let us try one of their more expensive sake. Theres also an English menu but I didnt really meet any tourists down there. All locals. The beef that they use here is all A5 wagyu and it makes a big difference. Extremely flavourful, tender,  juicy. Dont even bother to think. Just go. Missing this place during your Japan trip is just criminal. Yakiniku at its finest.

**let me share with you guys one incident on why I rate this place so highly. The first time I reached there at 4:45pm I only made it to the second seating, I only got in close to 8pm.

On our last day in Tokyo we had an 8pm train to Matsumoto. However we wanted to come back again to also thank the lady boss for being so kind to us. We got there at 4pm, dragging our luggage behind us on a weekend. There was already 20+ people in the queue. We were crushed. However amazingly at 5 plus when their guy came out to take orders we were told that we managed to make in into the 1st seating.

So we waited until 6pm but as the eager customers were ushered in bit by bit until it finally came to our turn they told us that inside was full. We had to wait for the second seating. So we were disappointed again. We had to weigh the options of hoping to get in around 7pm have a quick bite and rush back for the 8pm train or try our luck on the 9pm train. We decided to wait until 7 to see if anyone would somehow leave early.

Here‚Äôs the thing about having yakiniku on a weekend. You go in with ur best buds to have the meat feast of your life. You drink, you eat, you order somemore. One eating session takes about 1.5 to 2 hours. When 7pm came about we sadly informed the staff that we would be forfeiting our queue and we requested to take back our luggage from their store which they kindly help us to store earlier. As I was wearing my bags and taking my luggage, the big boss himself came rushing out and told me to wait for 2 mins. He will get me a table. Apparently the staff told their boss about our situation and the boss managed to get a Japanese couple inside to leave early to accommodate us. As we entered the restaurant amazed we saw the boss and the female boss apologising to those 2 profusely.

This act really impacted me greatly. They went out of their way to let us dine at their place one last time, made sure our food had first priority over others, apologised to us over the 1st&2nd seating incident ,helped us to order their signatures and lastly got a taxi for us to the train station. We made it for the 8pm train.

I doubt many other places in japan would do that for 2 tourists. Hence this is why I rate this place so highly.

Damage: 13,000-17,000 yen for 2 pax. But for the quality and amount it was certainly worth it imo.I went there twice.

Overall: 5/5

\- **Menya Itto (Ramen)** [https://tabelog.com/en/tokyo/A1312/A131204/13111737/](https://tabelog.com/en/tokyo/A1312/A131204/13111737/) /  [https://ramendb.supleks.jp/s/27327.html](https://ramendb.supleks.jp/s/27327.html) 

Tabelog 2019 Bronze. 3rd ranked Tsukemen on ramendb. I use ramendb and tabelog these 2 websites to source for ramen spots in Japan. Just use google translate to navigate, its a goldmine of ramen shops that you have never heard in your life or from tripadvisor websites. Put in some effort and you will be rewarded. Easily accessible, recommended time to get there is 10am to get a queue ticket as well as to buy your ramen from the ticket machine and hand it over to their guy. Ask for the english menu. Reaching at 10am gets you in the first seating at 10:55 to 11am. The good thing about itto that the queue moves fast. Many Japanese male adults finished slurping their bowl of ramen heaven in less than 10 mins. And here I thought I was a fast eater myself. Choose the 1300 yen special tsukemen or the char siu tsukemen. The former gives seaweed the other gives you more pieces of pork. 

Food pics: [https://imgur.com/a/HuukJCy](https://imgur.com/a/HuukJCy)

People come here for Tsukemen not for the ramen. My girlfriend had the shio ramen and regretted it.Hence we went 2 times lol. Noodles are bloody chewy, broth is a rich mix of meat and seafood flavor that does not leave you dying of thirst after every slurp, the menma (bamboo shoots)has a firm bite and a really good flavor but I need to give special mention to that egg of menya itto. Ive eaten at a few highly rated ramen shops in Japan but my effing god, no one else even comes close to Itto's egg. The yolk is so well seasoned with what I feel is not just normal soy sauce. Just go try it, and do add an additional egg while you are there. Another one of those ""dont think, just go"" places. Look I wanted to try Tomita ok  [https://tabelog.com/en/chiba/A1203/A120302/12000422/](https://tabelog.com/en/chiba/A1203/A120302/12000422/) /  [https://ramendb.supleks.jp/s/282.html](https://ramendb.supleks.jp/s/282.html) but it was just too far.

They have a seating area for dine in customers. Menu was about 5-6 dessert items. Seemed average to me only. Wont return.

Tabelog 2019 Bronze. Wanted to try their foie gras hotpot so made a reservation. But you do not need to make one, restaurant was surprisingly empty. Only 2 other groups were in the restaurant. When we reached we were told that they could not serve as the hotpot as the minimum people required was 4pax. We were really disappointed but agreed to have their omakase menu which was about 10+ dishes? Cant really remember exactly.

They serve chicken sashimi so take note for picky eaters. Wasnt exactly the most delicious thing there but o well I managed to down it with a few glups of beer. Cooked chicken dishes were good. Standout dishes were the fried chicken, chicken thigh skewers as well as the porridge. You can choose for a porridge or noodle to end off the meal. Both were very good. Desert was sweetened tomatoes. Kinda disappointed to be honest. Wasnt really blown away but was just pretty good yakitori that i feel i could have found else where for a fraction of the price. Might return for the foie gras hotpot though.

Whats a Tokyo trip without the 4am pilgrimage to the legendary Sushi Dai? My advice is to reach there about 4.15 to 4.30 for 1st seating. And your only option is a taxi or if you drive by car. Public transport won‚Äôt open so early so do take note. We reached at 4.20 and there was already a queue of close to 10 people infront. They will come out at around 5 plus to ask for your dietary restrictions as well as your order (everyone went for the omakase). Its about 4500 yen for 11 pieces if i recall correctly.

Sushi for me is pretty much split into 2 camps. Either it tastes freakin great and packs a huge load of flavor or its just pretty bland but chewy stuff. Sushi Dai has a pretty good mix of both but im more inclined towards the former. I mean the flounder, squid, white fish are all ok but to me they are boring. I much prefer the ikura roe, uni, otoro kind of pieces and the good thing about here is that after you finish your course they let you order whatever you like. It was freakin awesome, just go order that piece or pieces that you have always wanted to try dont feel shy. Overall, imo if its your first time in Japan, just wake up, grab a cab go and queue for this. I can safely say you wont regret it. I recommend staying at a hotel near sushi Dai so u can take a short hike over in the morning,etc Hotel Daiwa ( this brand of hotel is really good and quite reasonably priced)

**i know how some people might ask if sushi dai is overrated and this is my opinion. Some sushi pieces will taste good irregardless of the Chef skill since it‚Äôs heavily dependent on the freshness of the ingredients. The pieces that come to my mind on my favourite sushi pieces are Uni,otoro, ikura and sweet shrimp. All these taste so much fresher, cleaner and sweeter than those I get back in my home country. At sushi dai you aren‚Äôt going to get Super crispy seaweed, red vinegared rice, aged/smoked sushi, or any little tweaks that other chefs might do for their own sushi. What u get is a sushi place that due to its proximity to the Toyosu fish market is able to offer me my fav sushi pieces for a fraction of the price in my home country yet 2 to 3 times the flavour. So I say to you guys who might still be on the fence over visiting this place, just go and have the Omakase. But the real fun begins after it. Go ahead and try what the Sea of Japan can offer you. Pretty sure you won‚Äôt regret it.

Tabelog 2019 Bronze. Opens at 11am, get there at 10.40 and you will be fine. Pro tip, choose the cakes towards the left of the counter while facing it ( only those few can be eaten at the shop, do not feel pressured and rush through your selection even though theres a queue behind you of hungry and angry people).  You can choose 2 cakes to eat in so CHOOSE WISELY. Takeaway limit im not sure but we took away 2.Staff will stop you even if you try to take a photo of your own cake while eating it. Too bad i managed to snag one shot Ôºö/ Oh yea you have to order a mandatory drink to go along with your cake so take note of the extra cost for those planning their budgets.

16,000 yen for 3 slices of beef. So 2 pax it came up to 30,000+ yen for 6 slices of beef.

Food pics: [https://imgur.com/a/f3pi8ol](https://imgur.com/a/f3pi8ol)

For that price I could have gone to Sutamina-En and ate 10 times the amount. Beef was good but I found out it tastes much better grilled ala Yakiniku style. This place really made me feel that Sutamina-En was so much value for money. Rest of the meal was forgettable. Appetizers , filler vegetables & dessert was meh.Wont be returning and I urge people who might want to try this place to stay away.

\*\*\*TAKE NOTE\*\*\* The prices on their website for reservation even after you have listed for 2 people is actually only for 1!!! This was something that pissed me off greatly. I thought it was supposed to be 16,000yen for  2pax. !Beware!

Tabelog 2019 Silver. I only found 3 dishes that met my expectations. The prawn, the rice dish and the dessert. Dont get my wrong, the batter was really good but vegetables and white fish through the entire course made it so boring that I found myself waiting for the meal to end and go out to the nearest yakitori joint.

Bit into the pork and the only thought was ""sh\*t, this tastes so f\*\*\*\*n good"". Do note I went to the main store which is helped by the original Chef and only takes reservations online via omakase website. They have another outlet which accepts walk-ins helmed by his apprentice. Had both the filet and the loin. The filet Ôºàround balls, I had the chateaubriand cut which was one of the most expensive items on the menu due to its rarityÔºâ were leaner and had a firmer bite. But I preferred the fatty loin, there was another option that was like special rib loin but it was sold out when I got there at 8pm. So if you are going to this place I strongly recommend you try that special rib loin first . Type of pork just choose tokyo X seems like everyone was choosing it. I only had one Tonkatsu meal in Tokyo but i will wager 10,000yen anytime that this is the absolute best place for tonkatsu in Tokyo hands down. Batter is ethereally light and crunchy and that pork..let me describe it to you. You know how aging beef gives its a stronger flavor? This is how I would describe that pork. Immediately upon sinking my teeth into it I was strucked by the strong yet clean taste of pork. No gaminess whatsoever, its 100% pure pork flavor. The LOIN is such a perfect balance of fat and meat that the mouthfeel is so disgustingly luxurious yet it does not leave an oily or nauseating aftertaste that you get from too much greasy food. And the tonkatsu batter gives it that crunch which makes it all the more addictive. They had a collection of sauces to go with your pork, mustard, worcestershire, seaseme oil, soy sauce eg but whatever you choose to complement your pork, the flavor of the pork still shines strongly through. Thats how flavorful their pork is, its pork cutlet on jap steriods.Take note they open their reservations every month in advance and slots fill up quickly.

This kinda rounds up what I ate in tokyo. Will do up a further review on more restaurants that I tried during my trip if I have the time. Oh yea, I did try Ichiran. And its f\*\*\*\*n bullshit ramen. Just skip it and save yourself a valuable dinner slot somewhere else. I‚Äôll like to add on that this is solely my opinion. For starters, my Girlfriend loves it. I do not have any animosity against people who like it.

\*\*TL/DR\*\* In Tokyo, top 3 places are Sutamina-En(Yakiniku), Itto (Ramen), Narikura (Tonaktsu). Sushi Dai comes in at 4th on my list & Hidemi Sugino for dessert.",https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/e1zu2q/i_spent_18_days_in_japan_this_is_what_i_ate_in/,"You not suppose to take tsukemen ""soup"" undiluted.. It too salty you need clear stock to lower the saltiness.

You can request for it after your finished your ramen (or you can skip finishing the undiluted sauce totally)","This is a great post! I'm so sorry you had a bad experience with that expensive sukiyaki place. Honestly, sukiyaki is the sort of dish that's awesome done at home gathered around the kotatsu. It sucks you spent like 30k on it...

Also seems like a logical takeaway from this post is that the Tabelog Bronze/Silver places were not really up to snuff. Has this been anyone else's experience? I always find that the inconvenience that comes with a highly-rated tabelog page is rarely worth it. 

You also seem to have spent quite a lot on some 2/5 meals. Would you do anything different next time?

I also agree Ichiran is overrated and overpriced. And consistency is really NOT an issue. All their food comes pre-made. The staff just heat it up. Japanese people always mention how there's no knives at Ichiran locations. It's not really handmade, lovingly crafted stuff like you'd get at a local shop.",">  the flounder, squid, white fish are all ok but to me they are boring. I much prefer the ikura roe, uni, otoro kind of pieces 

You prefer fattier & higher cholesterol foods, and there is no shame in that (I live in America, where those flavors also dominate).  

Maybe you were judged by some chefs for having a basic palate but over time and repeated trips to Japan you may start to venture towards more balance flavors.  

I appreciate your reviews, much more effort than what shows up on the typical reddit post.","Just wondering, what did you not like about Ichiran? I always hear good things. Is it all just hype?","Narikura was probably the best meal I‚Äôve ever had. I didn‚Äôt know they had more than one location, but the one I went to in January didn‚Äôt require a reservation. They did have a waiting list at the door though, so we found a nearby cafe to kill the hour or two. I had the Tokyo X pork in the fattiest cut available, and it was just insanely good. You‚Äôve nailed the description too, somehow it‚Äôs a super intense pork flavour without being at all overpowering. God I can‚Äôt wait to go back one day.

We also tried Marugo, which is the other place many people compare it to. It was a great meal too, but maybe a 7 or 8 compared to Narikura‚Äôs perfect 10."
13qy2vd,Hiiii we‚Äôre talking menstrual cycle in Japan,"Okay so for anyone who has a uterus who is considering traveling to Japan and may start their cycle, this is for you. 

I did not expect to start mine at all and what do you know a week into a two week trip and  I start spotting üôÉ I am a person who can have a very heavy flow (I have a copper IUD) so I typically have to use Super + tampons for one to two days of my cycle. 

I found out (again didn‚Äôt do my research bc I didn‚Äôt think I would be starting my cycle while on my trip) that tampons are not‚Ä¶ really‚Ä¶ a thing‚Ä¶ JAPAN HAS THEM! But it‚Äôs a tiny little section at the bottom of the shelf and I did not see any options for Super + üò¨

So here I am, two days later, cleaning some stained laundry. 

Point is, I would recommend if you like to use tampons (and you have a preference on the kind you use) that you bring a few extra absorbent in your luggage just in case. Just a PSA for someone who didn‚Äôt prepare! üëçüèª

UPDATE: the day after I made this post, I found ‚ÄúSuper +‚Äù tampons at Life, a supermarket in the Fukushima district of Osaka and 

REVIEW: they were really not very absorbent, especially for someone with a heavy flow I bled through in about three hours üò¨ I continued to change every three hours after that and it was okay.. for reference, a typical Super + tampon in the US lasts me at least five hours and I rarely bleed through, and when I do it‚Äôs not nearly as much blood. 

Also, so happy this post blew up! I had no idea how much other people needed this info!

Summary: if you have a super heavy flow and like US absorbency levels, bring some! It seems like menstrual cups work great for a ton of people and I‚Äôm also hearing that period underwear is sold at Uniqlo and they work pretty well. It seems like Diva cups are hard to come by in Japan stores and some said pads aren‚Äôt as absorbent as they would like. 

Lastly, doesn‚Äôt hurt to have some spares for your fellow travelers and apparently meat tenderizers work for getting period stains out! Stay safe + dry out there y‚Äôall ü´°",https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/13qy2vd/hiiii_were_talking_menstrual_cycle_in_japan/,"Super plus tampons exist as well, and at least in big cities they can absolutely be found in bigger pharmacies.

**Also of note is the [recommendation by a panel of experts to continue closures for another 10 days beyond what has already been noted](https://english.kyodonews.net/news/2020/03/29c7cf7a3604-urgent-abe-extends-request-for-event-cancellations-amid-virus-spread.html) in the comments. We will be updating the closures thread as necessary as companies extend the break.**

##**TOURISM UPDATE 03/08**

**Border control increase begins today in Japan.** [**NHK has an article on the general guidelines for border control at this time.**](https://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/en/news/20200309_01/)  

**We have reprinted the article in full below.**  

>Japan increased border control measures on Monday in an effort to prevent the spread of the new coronavirus.

>**The government is asking people arriving from China and South Korea, including Japanese nationals, to stay at home or other private accommodation for two weeks at their own expense.**

>**Officials are asking those travelers to refrain from using public transportation, including planes, trains, buses and taxis, and use private or rental cars from the airport of their entry to their homes or accommodation facilities.**

>Visitors are asked to declare to quarantine officials where they will stay during the first two weeks as well as their means of transportation from the airport. They will be asked to remain at the airport until arrangements are ready.

>During the two-week period they will be asked to check their health daily. If they develop a fever and other symptoms they are asked to call a consultation center and visit a designated hospital.

>The measures are expected to remain in effect until the end of this month. **They are not legally-binding, but the health ministry is asking for cooperation.**

**Once again, we would advise if you have a stopover in any of the affected countries (China, Korea, Hong Kong, Macau - named specifically.) that you contact your airline to change your flight as soon as possible. These measures will be in force until the end of this month at the very least.**

##**TOURISM UPDATE 03/06**

>[**""Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe: ""We will ask people entering Japan from the two countries to stay at places designated by the quarantine chief for two weeks and not to use public transportation systems in the country.""**](https://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/en/news/20200306_02/)

>**A more in depth explanation of the restrictions is explained** [**here.**](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2020/03/05/national/japan-quarantine-arrivals-china-south-korea/#.XmHjSyhKiUk) 

>**This appears to be seperate from a bigger bill aimed at reducing the number of overall tourists at this moment to halt the spread of the virus.** [**The NHK has posted an article on the other measures of the bill,**](https://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/en/news/20200305_50/) **and how it will allow the Government to enact a State Of Emergency - giving them the power to ""control some businesses' operating hours, close schools and instruct people to stay indoors. Authorities would also be able to use buildings and land without their owners' consent for medical purposes.""**  

**In short, if you are a Korean or Chinese National, you will not be allowed to enter the country without facing a 14 day quarantine. Any planes arriving from either location will only be processed at either Narita or Kansai Airport, starting March 9th, and lasting until March 31st. It will also include visitors from Hong Kong and Macau, as well as Japanese Nationals coming from these countries - we are assuming this includes those returning from vacation in those areas. Entry Visas are being cancelled, for China, Korea, Hong Kong, Macau, and Iran which sounds like it means you will be quarantined at the border, and could be sent home after the 14 days are up.**

**If you have a flight with a stopover in either country, you would be wise to contact your airline right away and arrange to either fly direct, or re-route through a different area to avoid getting caught up in the quarantine. We have no confirmation that stopovers are excluded OR included in this requirement, but it's better to be safe than sorry.**

##**TOURISM UPDATE 02/28**  

>[**The Japanese Government has rolled out requirements to help curb the spread of the virus, as the next two weeks are crucial for transmission within the country.**](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2020/02/25/national/science-health/japan-guidelines-covid19-coronavirus/#.XlaKGChKiUk)  

##**TOURISM UPDATE 02/04:**

**The JNTO (Japan National Tourism Organization) is advising any and all tourists arriving in Japan to have travel health insurance in case they require treatment or hospitalization as a result of contracting the virus. The Government of Japan *will NOT cover the costs* associated with treatment during this time, and you *will* be required to pay out of pocket should an infection occur, and you have no insurance.**  

[**More information can be found at the following link from the JNTO, along with links to companies that will provide travel health insurance IN Japan on arrival.**](https://www.japan.travel/en/news/coronavirus/)  

**We strongly recommend you add Trip Cancellation *and* Travel Health Insurance to your budget before you depart - for precisely this kind of occurrence. Please take the time to research travel insurance, and confirm with your bank or personal health care plan what is covered, or not covered, and purchase a plan that meets your needs in accordance with your trip.** 

##**TOURISM UPDATE 01/31:**

**The NHK has published an article reporting that JNTO has a phone number to call should tourists *currently in Japan* require assistance. We would not recommend contacting this number if you are not currently in the country, as this line is intended to assist with possible cases and have them directed to medical facilities for treatment.** [The article has been removed, but we have a link to the phone numbers here.](https://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/en/news/20200131_41/amp.html) There is also a link to the JNTO for further information, if needed.

1by2wdr,Learnings & recommendations from 17 days in Tokyo/Hakone/Kawaguchiko/Kyoto/Osaka from a Londoner,"We‚Äôve just finished a 17-day trip to Japan and have a bunch of learnings and recommendations that will hopefully help others. We‚Äôre definitely not experts, and I‚Äôm sure we misinterpreted a few things, but these are the things we‚Äôll be bearing in mind if/when we go back. Worth mentioning that we‚Äôre very food-focused travellers!

Prices are quoted in yen (¬•) in case the exchange rate fluctuates significantly, but we‚Äôve also included some approximate costs in today‚Äôs ¬£. For our trip, ¬•1000 = ¬£5.30.


# Itinerary summary

We flew directly from London to Tokyo‚Äôs Haneda Airport, so we lost the first and last days of our trip to the \~14 hour flight. The remaining 15 days included:

- Tokyo (4 days inc. day trip to Kamakura)

- Mount Fuji 5 Lakes Region (3 days)

  - Hakone (2 days, 1 night)

  - Lake Kawaguchiko (2 nights, 1 day)

- Kyoto (4 days inc. day trip to Nara)

- Osaka (3 days)

- Tokyo (1 final day/night before flight)


# Overall learnings

## Money

- We had read that Japan is still very cash-centric, but \~80% of our purchases were by card (Mastercard and Amex). Cards are accepted at most shops, bars and restaurants, and all convenience stores.

  - The notable exception to this was the Suica card for public transport (see below) which can only be topped up with cash.

  - Many places accepted card but not Google/Apple Pay ‚Äì you needed the physical card and sometimes you had to sign for it.

  - Tourist attractions (e.g. temples) are often cash only but rarely expensive.

  - There are ATMs in almost all convenience stores, which are abundant, so if you do run out of cash it‚Äôs easy to nip out to get some more.

- Generally Japan was less expensive than we‚Äôd expected given what we‚Äôd heard, though this might be due to the particularly weak yen right now. Some typical prices:

  - Ramen: ¬•1200 (\~¬£6)

  - Beer in a restaurant: ¬•500-600 (¬£2.50-3)

  - Glass of sake in a restaurant: ¬•400 (¬£2)

  - Sushi platter for 1 in a sushi restaurant: ¬•2500 (¬£13)

  - Sashimi platter for 2 in an izakaya: ¬•2000 (\~¬£10)

  - 1-way subway journey: ¬•200 (¬£1)

  - 1-way train to day-trip destination like Nara: ¬•1500 (¬£8)

  - 1-way standard-class bullet train ticket with reserved seats, e.g. Osaka->Tokyo: ¬•15,000 (¬£80)

  - Coffee: ¬•200 (¬£1) from a convenience store, ¬•600 (¬£3) from a coffee shop, ¬•1000 (¬£5) from a specialist coffee shop

  - Hotels: we spent an average of \~¬•20,000 per night (¬£100) for hotels of a reasonable standard (think 3-4 stars)


## Transport

- It‚Äôs an _absolute must_ to get an ‚ÄòIC card‚Äô, Japan‚Äôs equivalent of an Oyster card. 

  - The dominant brand of IC card is ‚ÄúSuica‚Äù in Tokyo. It works all over Japan, across different train/bus companies, even in convenience stores.

  - There are other brands like ‚ÄúPasmo‚Äù, but Suica is the easiest to get hold of as there‚Äôs a machine to get a ‚ÄúWelcome Suica‚Äù which is valid for 28 days for visitors at Haneda airport.

    - As of right now, you can only get these at the airport. So don‚Äôt leave the airport without getting one!

    - Note that you can‚Äôt get back unused credit when you leave, so don‚Äôt top up much more than you will use.

  - You top up the Suica card with cash (only cash) and then use it to tap in/out of subway lines. It calculates the correct fare for you and deducts it from your balance. 

  - Without a Suica, you‚Äôll have to buy paper tickets everywhere. This has the potential to be a nightmare, as the subway system is run by many different companies, which can mean multiple tickets per journey if you‚Äôre changing lines.

  - Apparently there is a way to get your Suica on your iPhone and use it via NFC. Potentially this can also be topped up via credit card rather than just cash. But we didn‚Äôt try this as only one of us has an iPhone and only Android phones bought in Japan are supported.

  - Every station has machines to ‚Äòcharge‚Äô your Suica with cash. If you go on an expensive journey and your balance doesn‚Äôt cover it, you won‚Äôt be allowed back through the gates, but there are ‚Äúfare adjustment‚Äù machines to recharge there and let yourself out.

- The subway systems in Tokyo, Kyoto and Osaka were all great. 

  - Clear signage in English in all the stations; announcements and digital displays on trains switch between English and Japanese every few seconds.

  - All the stations are numbered as well as named, which makes things extra easy. Sometimes the Japanese names can seem similar to an English-speaker, but if you know you‚Äôre going from J-12 to J-16, there‚Äôs no room for confusion.

  - They‚Äôre all very clean, largely because there is no eating or drinking allowed on any train. They‚Äôre also incredibly quiet as phone calls aren‚Äôt allowed and people keep talking to a whisper.

- Google Maps worked incredibly well everywhere we went (even for more-remote bus journeys).

  - Although the station signage is clear, the maps are not. It‚Äôs much easier to let Google figure it out for you. It will even tell you what exit to use and where to get on the train to reduce your time spent walking down the platform.

  - Sometimes the train will change subway while you‚Äôre on it. Google Maps will helpfully say ‚ÄúRemain on board‚Äù even though it might not be obvious from the map.

  - Note that some stations are huge, and Google Maps doesn‚Äôt always properly account for walking from one platform to another. We didn‚Äôt find this to be a problem as the trains are regular enough for it not to matter (e.g. every 6 minutes). It‚Äôs something to watch out for when getting the Shinkansen (bullet train).

- The Shinkansen (bullet trains) are awesome. Super punctual, clean and quick. 

  - You can check prices and book up to a month in advance at <https://baolau.com/> ‚Äì you get a QR code to pick up your tickets at the station. This was super easy and meant our longer journeys were low-stress as we‚Äôd reserved seats. It seems like this was worth it as every train we got was full or close to full.

  - You can pick up tickets you‚Äôve bought online at any major train station. It‚Äôs worth doing this in advance of the day you travel in case there‚Äôs a queue at the station (they can get long).

  - For one short journey (Kyoto to Osaka) we didn‚Äôt reserve tickets because there are trains every \~5 minutes and it‚Äôs only a \~15 minute journey. But the queue for the Shinkansen ticket machines was so long, we spent longer queuing than we spent on the train!

  - You can get delicious ‚Äúekiben‚Äù (bento boxes of food for the train) at the station. Don‚Äôt underestimate the quality of these, we had some great sushi for \~¬•1000 (¬£5). Food and drink is allowed on Shinkansen.

  - It didn‚Äôt seem like the green car (first class) upgrade was worth it. You get so much legroom in standard class.


## Language

- We had heard that the level of English was very low but we were pleasantly surprised by how many people could at least get by speaking English. We were actively seeking out less touristy places and we never had an issue communicating, even when there was no English spoken.

- There are a handful of Japanese phrases that we found incredibly useful:

  - Ari-ga-to gozai-masu: ‚Äúthank you‚Äù

    - This is the polite version of thank you. You don‚Äôt pronounce the ‚Äúu‚Äù at the end, it just sounds like ‚Äúmass‚Äù. 

    - If you elongate the a to be like ‚Äúmaaaaas‚Äù then that seems to indicate more enthusiasm. We never heard anyone say ‚Äúdomo arigato‚Äù (thank you very much), so it seems like this elongation is the preference.

    - We were surprised how rarely ‚Äúarigato‚Äù (the casual version) was used.

    - If you don‚Äôt bother with anything else, this is the one to learn. 

  - Fu-tari desu: ‚Äúwe are two‚Äù (again, don‚Äôt pronounce the u)

    - This is all you need to get a table at a restaurant as a couple. You‚Äôd probably be fine just gesturing the number 2, but it seems a bit more polite to say something as you do it.

    - If you are asked ‚Äúnan desu ka?‚Äù when you walk in that means ‚Äúhow many are you?‚Äù, to which this is the correct answer as a couple.

  - Ku-da-sai: ‚Äúplease‚Äù

    - To order in a restaurant you just say the name of the thing and then this phrase afterwards. E.g. ‚Äúbƒ´ru kudasai‚Äù means ‚Äúcan I have a beer please?‚Äù

    - There‚Äôs a polite version of ‚Äòplease‚Äô which is interchangeable: ‚Äúonegaishimasu‚Äù (maybe just Google how to pronounce that one!)

  - KƒÅ-do de: ‚Äúpay by card‚Äù

    - Unlike in the UK where it‚Äôs assumed that you will pay by card, often in Japan you have to explicitly say it or they will wait for you to hand them cash without setting up the card machine.

    - You can make this more polite by saying ‚ÄúkƒÅdo de kudasai‚Äù which means ‚ÄúI‚Äôd like to pay by card please‚Äù.

    - The word for cash is ‚Äúgenkin‚Äù so if you hear that in a response, it probably means they only take cash. Most people know the phrase ‚Äúcash only‚Äù though, even if they don‚Äôt speak much English.

- We used Google Translate‚Äôs camera function extensively to translate written Japanese, e.g. when there was no English menu. This works incredibly well, and we had a lot more confidence to visit places with no English (e.g. particularly local restaurants) as a result.

- The couple of times we struggled to communicate what we needed to say, we just used Google translate to generate the Japanese and showed it to the person on our phones. Some Japanese people also did this with us without being prompted.


## Food and drink

Food was the thing we were most excited about when planning our trip and it did not disappoint! There is lots to say. We‚Äôve left specific recommendations to the sections below that focus on each of the places we visited. Some overall tips and learnings:

- The standard is very high everywhere. Even on train station platforms or at national chain restaurants where in the UK you would expect awful ultra-processed food, we were never disappointed.

  - NB: we stuck almost exclusively to Japanese food. Maybe this wouldn‚Äôt be true of western cuisine.

- There‚Äôs absolutely no tipping anywhere. Some Japanese even see tipping as rude.

- Outside of izakayas (more on them below), the restaurant culture is very focused on the food. This means service is quick and efficient, you don‚Äôt spend much time at the restaurant other than eating, and conversation is kept quiet to avoid distracting people from their food. You‚Äôre often sat at a bar in a more ‚Äòsolo‚Äô stance, even if you‚Äôre with someone else. 

  - In some places, you will be expected to order while you queue. Sometimes you will even pay before you sit down, and when you‚Äôre finished eating you just get up and leave. 

  - This means it‚Äôs hard to make a whole evening out of a visit to a restaurant like you might in the UK. 

- The places that take this to the extreme (often ramen places) will have a vending machine at the front. You put in cash, push the buttons for what you want, receive tickets and hand them to the server. 

- Izakayas offer quite a different vibe. They come in all shapes and sizes, but broadly speaking they are like a cross between a tapas bar and a gastro pub. There is an expectation that you drink, and there is also an expectation that you eat. But if you don‚Äôt eat loads, it‚Äôs okay. And you don‚Äôt have to order everything all at once.

  - If you don‚Äôt eat, there is normally a cover charge of \~¬•400-500 (\~¬£2) in the form of a small appetiser.

  - We were taught that at an izakaya you should follow these steps, which helps explain the concept:

    - Drink. Order a bit of food.

    - Order more drinks. Order more food. Repeat until you‚Äôre nearly ready to go home.

    - Order some food with carbs to fill you up. Go home.

  - This can be quite a nice way to spend an evening if you don‚Äôt want to be in-and-out at a ramen restaurant or similar. There‚Äôs definitely less pressure to leave, especially if you‚Äôre still ordering drinks.

- They have a big drinking culture, although you don‚Äôt see many drunk people until after midnight. The standard drinks served everywhere are:

  - Japanese lager (Asahi/Kirin/Sapporo)

  - A ‚Äúhighball‚Äù which (without any further qualification) is whiskey with ice and soda water in a tall glass. 

  - ‚ÄúChuhai‚Äù is short for ‚Äúshochu highball‚Äù. Shochu is like a vodka made from rice/barley/similar, but not quite as strong (normally 25%). Most common is the ‚Äúlemon sour‚Äù.

  - Sake. It varies a lot more than we realised (in price and taste). We were relative newcomers before but we loved it by the end of the trip! 

    - It‚Äôs hard to order from a menu or by looking at the bottles, as they‚Äôre all in Japanese. You can normally explain what style you want to the server and they‚Äôll manage ‚Äì the simple options are light/rich and dry/sweet. So if you say ‚Äúlight dry sake‚Äù they will know what to bring. 

    - Some places serve it hot but the majority of the time it‚Äôs cold. 

    - It‚Äôs probably not worth ordering if they only have a single cheap option, just like it‚Äôs often not worth ordering wine in a pub in the UK.

    - It‚Äôs normally ordered by the ‚Äòglass‚Äô (90ml) or carafe (180ml).

- They take their cocktails very seriously and there are some amazing cocktail bars. See city-specific section below for specific recommendations.

  - At first they can seem very whiskey-focused. They really love their whiskey and it‚Äôs not uncommon for good cocktail bars to have 50+ bottles behind the bar, at every possible price point, but they make other stuff too.

  - Many of them are tiny (8-12 seats at a bar, maybe 1 or 2 tables) and hidden in basements or on random floors of tall buildings. It‚Äôs very difficult to find them just walking along the street ‚Äì you need to check the floor on Google Maps to know where you‚Äôre going. 

  - They like the concept of a ‚Äúno menu‚Äù cocktail bar where you tell them what you like and they make something up. This also means you don‚Äôt know how much it will cost ‚Äì we were typically paying ¬•2000 (\~¬£11) so it wasn‚Äôt extortionate vs. London. There was also often a cover charge of ¬•500.

- There‚Äôs street food everywhere, particularly in the pedestrianised walking streets. We took the approach of sticking to places with a queue of people who didn‚Äôt look like tourists and we were never disappointed.

  - The one thing to watch out for when eating on the street is that there are no bins anywhere in public. It‚Äôs expected that if you buy street food, you eat it directly outside the stall. Walking and eating is considered rude as you risk making the street dirty.

  - There won‚Äôt always be a bin for used packaging/skewers visible at the street food stall, but vendors were always happy to have any litter handed back to them. This would be strange in the UK, but it‚Äôs expected there!

- Coffee is abundant but doesn‚Äôt match up to London coffee shops in terms of quality unless you visit the more specialist places. 

  - Convenience stores do pretty good, cheap iced coffees. Our favourite brand was Uchi Cafe from Lawson. Best to drink it in the shop to avoid carrying litter around.

- Convenience stores are everywhere and have some nice snacks for on-the-go food. We particularly liked the onigiri to fuel us in the mornings.

- Smoking is allowed indoors in Japan, which means some bars and restaurants will allow it. This is especially true of the whiskey-focused bars, rarer in restaurants.

  - We don‚Äôt smoke, but we didn‚Äôt find this a problem on our trip. We found ourselves in a smoking bar 2 or 3 times and it just meant we didn‚Äôt stay too long. The ventilation is normally pretty good.

  - It‚Äôs common enough that many hotels will have a spray in the wardrobe to prevent your clothes from smelling like smoke.

- We didn‚Äôt make any restaurant reservations in advance and we never compromised on where we ate because of a lack of availability.

  - If you want to eat in the high-end omakase restaurants where they do or could have a Michelin star, booking is essential. For anything else, there are so many options that you can always find somewhere.

  - Queueing is common but we never had to queue for more than 25 minutes for a table.


## Accommodation

- Generally we were very happy with the standard of accommodation. It was clean, comfortable and relatively inexpensive. Rooms were typically small but this didn‚Äôt bother us as we were light on luggage and spent minimal time in the hotels. If you have lots of luggage you might want to make sure you don‚Äôt get the smallest rooms.

- The more traditional places might only offer futons with relatively thin mattresses, and potentially Japanese pillows which are made from the husks of buckwheat seeds. We didn‚Äôt find these uncomfortable, but perhaps someone who likes a very soft mattress would.

- It‚Äôs surprisingly common to see separate beds in double rooms, e.g. 2 separate double beds. 


## Shopping

- Many shops across the country offer ‚Äútax free‚Äù shopping, removing Japan‚Äôs equivalent of VAT (normally 10%). 

  - You normally have to show your passport to qualify for this, which they use to check you haven‚Äôt been in the country for more than \~6 months. So if you‚Äôre going shopping, take your passport.

  - Some stores like Don Quijote have a minimum spend for tax-free shopping (e.g. ¬•5000)

- Generally (as you would expect) we found Japanese brands to be significantly cheaper than back home. Western brands were often more expensive, even accounting for tax-free.

  - E.g. Uniqlo is roughly 50% cheaper than in the UK, even before accounting for the tax-free shopping.

  - E.g. Sony headphones were \~40% cheaper than in the UK

- Some stores have discount codes that are specific to travellers looking for tax-free shopping. 


## Attractions

- We had heard that it‚Äôs good to visit attractions early to avoid the crowds. This was definitely true!

  - Some places we arrived around 8.30-9am and it was quiet (a few dozen people) and by the time we‚Äôd circled back round to the start by 11am it was packed (hundreds of people).

  - Unless you want there to be almost no one, it didn‚Äôt seem necessary to get there super early (e.g. 6am).

- For attractions on a hill or where there is potential to walk far (e.g. Fushimi Inari, Chureito Pagoda, Arashiyama Bamboo Forest) we found that without fail even if the start/centre of the attraction was packed, you could keep walking and soon enough it would be quiet again.

  - If in doubt, keep walking up the hill and it will get quieter! Clearly some people just want to get the photo and get out of there.


# Location-specific learnings

## Tokyo

### Overall

We loved Tokyo. It‚Äôs one of the few cities we‚Äôve been to that has a similar magnitude of breadth to offer as London whilst also feeling very different. It mixes the old and the ultra modern very well. The public transport is great. We expected it to feel busier, but outside of the main train stations and other hotspots, it was relatively relaxed and quiet. And it‚Äôs big enough that most people you see aren‚Äôt tourists, so you don‚Äôt feel like you‚Äôre in a tourist town. We stayed in Shinjuku but if we were to go back, we‚Äôd probably stay in Shibuya or nearby.


### Favourite areas

Like London, Tokyo is really a collection of different towns. We picked 2 or 3 per day and just wandered around to get a feel for them. Our favourites were:

- Shibuya ‚Äì this seemed to have the best bars and restaurants for what we were looking for. Not too touristy, also not too business-centric or residential. Soho would be the closest London equivalent.

- Harajuku & Omotesando ‚Äì especially in the backstreets here, it felt like the more ‚Äòhip‚Äô shopping area with more Japanese brands and small/independent shops (vs. somewhere like Ginza where it‚Äôs only Chanel, Balenciaga, Dior etc.). Shoreditch is probably the closest London equivalent.

- Asakusa & Kappabashi Street ‚Äì Asakusa has some nice indoor markets for street food around Senso-ji temple. Kappabashi Street is kitchenware central, with all of the best shops for Japanese knives.

- Tsukiji Market ‚Äì the market itself has moved elsewhere but the area retains its focus on fresh seafood with all kinds of street food stalls and sushi restaurants. Great atmosphere and great food, even if it is a bit touristy.

- Akihabara ‚Äì we‚Äôre not big anime/otaku culture fans but it was cool to see all the skyscrapers of retro gaming halls. We did have a play on some of the racing games (you can pay with Suica!)


### Best attractions

- TeamLabs Planets ‚Äì immersive art exhibition, quite unusual if you‚Äôve never done anything like it before, although similar exhibitions do exist around the world. Book a couple of weeks in advance. We spent about 90 minutes there. It‚Äôs near Tsukiji Market so it‚Äôs easy to combine the two.

- Meiji Shrine & Yoyogi Park ‚Äì a nice break from the hustle and bustle of the city with lots of greenery. We even saw a traditional wedding taking place.

- Don Quijote ‚Äì a chain of crazy ‚Äúvariety stores‚Äù that need to be experienced to be understood. Go to the ‚ÄòMega Don‚Äô in Shibuya for the full experience.

- Kamakura ‚Äì easy day trip from Tokyo, Hasedera Temple offers great views over the surrounding area


### Best restaurants

- [Tsukiji Sushi Say Honten](https://maps.app.goo.gl/9LvYCTrA133PfyZ88) ‚Äì great, fairly priced sushi in Tsukiji

- [Ginza Kagari](https://maps.app.goo.gl/BBbB55i7dVsVBSry6) ‚Äì the best ramen we had on our trip (chicken broth). We actually went to their branch in Kamakura but I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs equally good in both

- [This](https://maps.app.goo.gl/65GzGKvfFZvaKymP6) was our favourite izakaya ‚Äì no other Westerners and very friendly staff who just about got by with English. The sashimi was great and the sake was very high quality!

- [Toritake](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Q4nZr3ooPSCvua1q8) ‚Äì great yakitori (grilled meats). I think their specialty is eel but they seemed to have sold out when we went.


### Best bars

- [The SG Club](https://maps.app.goo.gl/4MNH3XpqWmB7JktZ6) ‚Äì rated as one of the 50 best bars in Asia, we were downstairs in their ‚Äòmore experimental‚Äô bar and had some of the best cocktails we‚Äôve ever had

- [Jazz Blues Soul Bar](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ZbsLHn5Un5Py65MW6) ‚Äì slightly hidden bar playing vintage records from a collection of \~10,000+. The owner is incredibly stern and doesn‚Äôt seem to like that customers interrupt his listening, but it‚Äôs a cool experience if you can ignore that.

- [Bar High Five](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Y2xQf7ZzEET3bK1S6) ‚Äì the name sounds tacky but it‚Äôs actually a very high-end cocktail bar with no menu. They ask what you like and make something up. Again some of the best cocktails we‚Äôve ever had, although almost everyone here was a tourist which never feels great.


## Hakone

We only stayed one night in Hakone, having rented a car and driven from Odawara station. The drive is super easy. 

The primary reason for visiting was to stay at a rural ryokan (traditional Japanese inn). We stayed at [Kijitei Hoeiso](https://maps.app.goo.gl/9LvYCTrA133PfyZ88) and it was definitely one of the highlights of the trip. It was expensive at \~¬•76,000 but this did include a delicious kaiseki dinner, breakfast, full use of their indoor onsen and private booking of their outdoor onsen next to the river. I would highly recommend one night in a ryokan. You probably don‚Äôt need more than one night, particularly as multiple kaiseki dinners would probably be too repetitive. It‚Äôs best to check in early to make sure you make full use of the facilities.

Other than the ryokan, we didn‚Äôt find Hakone itself to have much to offer of the sorts of things we enjoy most. We did the boat trip across the lake and took the ropeway (cable car) up to the volcano ‚Äì both nice experiences but it all felt a bit too touristy for us. We enjoyed the Hakone Open-Air Museum (sculpture park) but it felt a little out of place.


## Lake Kawaguchiko

We drove from Hakone to Lake Kawaguchiko and spent 2 nights (but only 1 full day). We enjoyed this area much more than Hakone for 3 reasons: we had clear views of Mount Fuji (perhaps just luck); there were more active things to do like hiking/cycling; it didn‚Äôt feel quite as touristy, perhaps because it‚Äôs more difficult to do as a day trip from Tokyo.

There isn‚Äôt really a clear ‚Äòcentre‚Äô to the town. We stayed in some very basic accommodation on one of the residential streets ‚Äì it was only ¬•10,000 per night (¬£55) but we did have bunk beds.


### Best attractions

- Chureito Pagoda ‚Äì we got here early so it wasn‚Äôt too busy and the views of Mt. Fuji are stunning. We did the short (\~40 minutes each way) hike up to Arakurayama Summit which was definitely worth it. Not a difficult hike (apart from some slightly icy bits near the top) and you‚Äôre rewarded with even better views, with zero tourists. It‚Äôs well signposted, but you need Google Translate as the signs are all in Japanese.

- Tenjozan Park ‚Äì we took the ropeway (cable car) up here and walked down. The views are also great of Mt. Fuji. We probably should have skipped the cable car and just walked up as well as down. You can‚Äôt see much from the cable car itself and the queues are long.

- Cycling around the lake ‚Äì we rented bikes from [here](https://maps.app.goo.gl/N6smUjDzKhQqGPmz6) and cycled the \~18km around Lake Kawaguchiko. It‚Äôs a mixture of bike lanes and roads, but there are so few cars it feels safe. Make sure to cycle anti-clockwise so you‚Äôre on the lake side throughout. It took us about 90 minutes but we probably should have stopped more often ‚Äì there are plenty of places along the way for food/drink.

- Driving to other lakes ‚Äì because we had a car, we did the short drive to see some of the other lakes like Saiko and Motosu, which were equally picturesque (particularly the ones with a reflection of Mt Fuji) and almost deserted.


### Best restaurants

- [Kosaku Kawaguchiko](https://maps.app.goo.gl/8vNKVvjmRaXvkHas5) ‚Äì the local dish is ‚Äòhoutou‚Äô, thick cut noodles and lots of vegetables stewed in miso soup. It‚Äôs delicious, very warming and incredibly filling. This is a traditional restaurant serving pretty much only this. You take your shoes off, put your name down and then are seated on the floor. There aren‚Äôt many choices to make, all the houtou options are virtually the same ‚Äì the only thing that changes is additional meat you can add (although in hindsight perhaps the veggie version would have been better).

- [High Spirits](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ivuG5Xqj6GQj9rWMA) ‚Äì a nice izakaya run by a couple who speak perfect English. The chef likes to chat to people at the bar. We had some great, varied food and spent a while here enjoying our evening, which was a nice change from some of the in-and-out restaurants.


## Kyoto

### Overall

We enjoyed Kyoto but we probably budgeted too much time here (4 days) given its best for its temples and gardens, which are less of a priority for us (temple fatigue is real!). Because it‚Äôs such a cultural and historical centre, with a population 90% smaller than Tokyo and a much smaller footprint, it feels a lot more touristy. Almost all of the time there are tourists around you in Kyoto, when they are easy to avoid in Tokyo. It‚Äôs also generally more expensive as there‚Äôs clearly more of a market catering to wealthy (often American) tourists.


### Best attractions

- Gion as a district is fun to walk around ‚Äì you see people dressed as geishas (some real, some tourists) and there are lots of old, traditional buildings. This is a more upmarket district so you‚Äôll find fancier restaurants here.

- Nishiki Market ‚Äì this is a long, covered street/indoor market with hundreds of street food vendors. Have a wander and try a few things!

- Teramachi Street ‚Äì perpendicular to Nishiki Market, another covered pedestrianised street but more focused on shopping, particularly clothes. Some interesting stuff, and it doesn‚Äôt require much time.

- Kiyamachi Street and Pontocho Alley ‚Äì this is the centre of the nightlife in the evenings. It‚Äôs buzzing, although it did get a bit rowdy later on when we were there.

- Arashiyama Bamboo Forest ‚Äì definitely worth a visit, arrive early and keep walking to get past the bulk of the tourists. If you walk up to Otagi Nenbutsuji via Saga Toriimoto you can see lots of nice preserved old houses with a few good ceramics shops.

- Fushimi Inari ‚Äì definitely touristy but well worth the visit, walk all the way to the top for the fewest tourists (we did manage to get some photos with no other people in them). When you‚Äôre back at the start, head down to Fushimi Sake district where they make some of the best sake, you can do tastings and there‚Äôs also a sake museum.

- Philosopher‚Äôs Path ‚Äì this is a nice little walk along the canal, although I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs better when there‚Äôs full blossom.

- Nijo Castle ‚Äì definitely some of the best gardens we saw anywhere. Arrive later before it shuts and enjoy golden hour here.

- Nara ‚Äì easy day trip from Kyoto, although really it should probably be considered a half-day trip. The deer are nice to see but there isn‚Äôt much else to see, and it‚Äôs very touristy.


### Best restaurants

- [Aiba Curry](https://maps.app.goo.gl/QfK2yytKxEEhA2LN9) ‚Äì we had one of our favourite meals of the trip here. We went for lunch and had ‚Äòomurice‚Äô (an omelette sliced open over rice) with curry sauce and fried chicken. A bit decadent and very filling but delicious!

- [Juju](https://maps.app.goo.gl/SHNczsiirvvRcuaa6) ‚Äì  tonkatsu restaurant specialising in lightly battered and fried pork cutlets. They are very high quality cuts of meat and they specify where each one comes from depending on availability. Each is served with rice, salad and an array of sauces and condiments. The meat is very fatty but it‚Äôs rendered well so the result is delicious even if it‚Äôs not something you could eat daily.

- [Kobushi Ramen](https://maps.app.goo.gl/GSDa4jAVySq9L59R9) ‚Äì more great ramen, a bit more unusual than the classic tonkotsu. They do duck and fish broth ramen, as well as spicy tantanmen. It‚Äôs been in the Michelin guide for many years running, and isn‚Äôt expensive at all.


### Best bars

- [Umineko](https://maps.app.goo.gl/xYWo2tAhb8KMaJdH7) ‚Äì a standing craft beer bar we absolutely loved, the beer was great (much of it is from their own brewery in Osaka) and the staff are super friendly.

- [Kazubar](https://maps.app.goo.gl/X5H7ueUfj92Q2wEeA) ‚Äì this is a candle-lit only bar almost entirely hidden on the 2nd floor of a very unassuming building, with no clear signage. The door looks incredibly dodgy but inside is very cool, if a bit high on the ‚Äòedgy‚Äô scale. One of the bartenders speaks English, there‚Äôs no menu but it‚Äôs not expensive. It was a bit smokey, but a cool experience.

- [Sakesora](https://maps.app.goo.gl/kay5ALc4fX14Hhjp9) ‚Äì this is a brewery and sake bar with a decent food selection. We only had a drink, which meant we paid a cover charge for some small appetisers (which were nice!), but the beer was very good.

- [This](https://maps.app.goo.gl/8TixztVxgrta7et17) bar was incredibly cute ‚Äì absolutely tiny and pretty much only Japanese speaking, but thankfully ‚Äúgin tonic‚Äù is the same in Japanese. I had one of the best gins I‚Äôve ever had here.

- [Bar K6](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Moq7HScWpVdYFSQ9A) ‚Äì huge spirit selection, quite an old school vibe although the place is quite large, surprisingly inexpensive given the vibe (¬•1200 for a cocktail, just over ¬£6).

- [Blue Bottle Coffee](https://maps.app.goo.gl/WP3xuigZvp4WfvV9A) ‚Äì not really a bar, but the best coffee shop we went to on our trip in a beautiful building. 


## Osaka

### Overall

Osaka is famed for its food (nicknamed the ‚ÄòKitchen of Japan‚Äô) and for its nightlife, and it definitely delivers on both, which made it one of our favourite spots on our trip. It almost feels like a mini-Tokyo as it has similar sorts of distinct areas but they‚Äôre on a much more compact scale. We didn‚Äôt get the subway at all in Osaka apart from getting in/out because it was so walkable ‚Äì whereas in Tokyo even if you walk a lot, you still need to get the subway often. There‚Äôs not a lot of typical tourist attractions but it‚Äôs a fun place to just wander and explore, particularly in the evenings. The locals here were the most friendly of anywhere.


### Best attractions

- [Dotonbori](https://maps.app.goo.gl/86fbpoVThZmdpgnn8) is a fun area to explore, both in the day and especially at night. You can walk along the river, along the main street, or along Hozenji Yokocho and soak it all up.

- Umeda Sky Building ‚Äì we went on a clear day and the views from the top were very good. It‚Äôs an interesting building with two skyscrapers joined at the top and some angled escalators through the sky. There‚Äôs a reasonably priced bar at the top, too.

- Kurumon Ichiba Market ‚Äì similar to Nishiki Market in Kyoto, lots of nice street food, particularly with a seafood focus

- Shi-Tennoji Temple Market ‚Äì only 2 days per month, an interesting flea market in the grounds of a temple. It seemed to be mostly locals there.

- Osaka Castle ‚Äì the building itself is surprisingly small and the queues were large so we didn‚Äôt go in, but the grounds are nice to walk around.

- Sennichimae Doguyasuji Shopping Street ‚Äì mini version of Kappabashi Street in Tokyo focusing on kitchenware.


### Best restaurants

- [Yakiniku-densetsu Baribari Sennichimae](https://maps.app.goo.gl/tBa7KqgMLBRn9KJC7) ‚Äì we had some very reasonably priced, high quality wagyu beef here. You cook it yourself, and the atmosphere isn‚Äôt as fancy as some of the omakase-style restaurants that serve high-end beef, but you save a lot of money for that compromise.

- [Okonomiyaki Sanpei](https://maps.app.goo.gl/EmnZiLdDbjUX4ux38) ‚Äì just off the tourist trail, this place specialises in the cabbage pancakes that originate from Osaka. Their specialty is a green onion and soy variety, with lots of fresh seafood, but they also do more classic varieties. It‚Äôs all cooked in front of you, and there are only a few seats, so be prepared to queue! 

- [This](https://maps.app.goo.gl/WLLb512hDkp7CnHx9) place specialises in kushikatsu ‚Äì a local food consisting of fried everything on skewers, which you dip in a special sauce. It‚Äôs tasty and worth a try, but we probably over-ordered and regretted having so much fried stuff. Maybe go for a small lunch!

- Takoyaki is another Osaka favourite ‚Äì fried balls of batter stuffed with octopus. We went [here](https://maps.app.goo.gl/HH3kehHAyCpo8jqC9) for our best of the trip after trying a few, but many places are good. Make sure to let them cool for a few minutes or you will incinerate your mouth. You might not be able to stand the [music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aM48pODu9G0) they play in the queue though.


### Best bars

- [Bar Shiki](https://maps.app.goo.gl/qxgpei4Tf7nKRRmd7) ‚Äì this was our favourite cocktail bar of the trip. The owner/bartender is insanely knowledgeable. There‚Äôs no menu, he just makes something up based on what you say you like. The breadth of ingredients (many of them home made) and his understanding of them was incredible, not to mention his enthusiasm!

- [Nihonshu to Watashi](https://maps.app.goo.gl/HarvhkkXtgLUoV9o6) ‚Äì this standing sake bar was recommended to us by another bartender. There were only locals there and the bartender was absolutely lovely but didn‚Äôt speak any English. It‚Äôs a funny concept where you pick a sake bottle from the fridge, and then let her pour it for you. You‚Äôre expected to order some food and it‚Äôs delicious ‚Äì we went after dinner and it was easy not to order anything big. The locals there were very friendly and overall it was one of our favourites of the trip.

- [Umineko](https://maps.app.goo.gl/zGVrowGRkw7m6HXB7) ‚Äì from the same brewery as one of our favourite bars in Kyoto, this is a tiny standing beer bar with great local craft beers and a very friendly atmosphere.

- [Milk Bar](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Pm3VMGAiUrXbGWiJ6) ‚Äì a music-focused vintage record bar serving cocktails. Similar to Blues Jazz Soul Bar in Tokyo, but with a much friendlier owner. 

- [Misono Building](https://maps.app.goo.gl/igbCiB1BQDXViXQd7) ‚Äì we heard good things about the bars on the 2nd floor of this building and went to investigate, but there were too many to choose from and we arrived too early in the evening so they were all empty. If you want something a bit edgier, check it out.",https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1by2wdr/learnings_recommendations_from_17_days_in/,">- Generally Japan was less expensive than we‚Äôd expected given what we‚Äôd heard, though this might be due to the particularly weak yen right now. Some typical prices:

  >- Ramen: ¬•1200 (\~¬£6)

  >- Beer in a restaurant: ¬•500-600 (¬£2.50-3)

  >- Glass of sake in a restaurant: ¬•400 (¬£2)

  >- Sushi platter for 1 in a sushi restaurant: ¬•2500 (¬£13)

  >- Sashimi platter for 2 in an izakaya: ¬•2000 (\~¬£10)

  >- 1-way subway journey: ¬•200 (¬£1)

  >- 1-way train to day-trip destination like Nara: ¬•1500 (¬£8)

  >- 1-way standard-class bullet train ticket with reserved seats, e.g. Osaka->Tokyo: ¬•15,000 (¬£80)

  >- Coffee: ¬•200 (¬£1) from a convenience store, ¬•600 (¬£3) from a coffee shop, ¬•1000 (¬£5) from a specialist coffee shop

  >- Hotels: we spent an average of \~¬•20,000 per night (¬£100) for hotels of a reasonable standard (think 3-4


Japan‚Äôs reputation for being expensive is one earned from the late 80s/early 90s. The weak yen helps (before the weak yen, your 1,200 yen Ramen would have been ¬£8 or so), but it was still relatively cheap when I went in 2019 when it was 130 yen to the pound

The main thing is the low historic inflation. Those yen prices have been largely unchanged since the 80s, where a bowl of ramen would still have been 1,000-1,200 yen, and still around ¬£7-¬£8. Difference is that in 1988, paying ¬£8 for a bowl of noodle soup would have been outrageous, whereas ¬£8 for a bowl of ramen in 2024 is an absolute steal","""Nan desu ka"" is simply ""What is it?""

What they are usually asking is ""nan mei sama?"" Which is ""how many people?"" 


Also you'll almost never hear ""arigatou"" because all of the staff speak super politely to their customers so they use what's called keigo or sonkeigo. You often hear ""arigatou"" or less polite forms of speech when talking with friends.",Mate fantastic write up. Great to get a British perspective on things as this really helps us plan out a similar itinerary. Certainly better than some write ups by a certain American person who likes to get Ubers and not change their clothes.,"Correction in case someone tries to say this at a store - cash is genkin, happy/good is genki",

Will wait.,"My girlfriend was literally there today to try and buy tickets as she is visiting family in the area and was told tickets are sold out for January through to the end of February and that in March they are making it so you have to be a Japanese resident with an address in Japan in order to purchase.

This completely contradicts this article and website... So which is it? Are these tickets purchased through Lawson, legal tickets? If so, I take it that this is an exception to the rule that she was told in person by an employed staff member?"
ekkh8r,"Weird request - I'm an Australian returning home soon and many of my friends are asking me to bring back smoke masks, as we've run out. I'm in Tokyo - where would I find a shop with masks/respirators?","Hi all,

What's one of the great things about Japan? Safety standards! What does Tokyo have a lot of? Construction!

[I'm looking for masks/respirators similar to these](https://www.lifehacker.com.au/2019/12/masks-smoke-bushfires-nsw-where-to-buy/) to bring home for friends and family with respiratory problems from 1+ month of hazardous air quality levels. Any store around the Yamanote line would be fine.

I'm making a wild assumption that Japanese people also have to deal with shitty air quality when it blows over from mainland China, so hopefully some of you all have experience with this kinda thing. Looking for something between your regular convenience store facemask and full on military hardware.

Any help would be awesome. Thanks everyone on JapanTravel for all the help and advice you consistently provide :)

Its a store that sells clothing/products for people in the trades. It looks like the closest one to a yamanote station is the one in Ota (Shinagawa -> Omori station).,"You want ""Home center"". Google Maps is fairly good at finding them. Business names to search for:

* Beaver Tozan
* Kuroganeya
* Shimachu
* Kohnan / Kohnan Pro (Pro is exclusively contractor-grade stuff)
* Super Viva Home
* Joyfull Honda

The last two are huge and sell to plenty of contractors. The down side to ""huge"" is they tend to be far from public transportation, and none are inside the Yamanote line. Smaller ones near suburban stations tend to not have the more specialized items. There is a Beaver Tozan in between Kyodo and Chitose-funabashi station, 15 minutes west of Shinjuku.

You can try Tokyu Hands in Shibuya, the tool floor. Hands tends to have things, but not have a lot of any particular thing in stock.

There's also [Amazon.co.jp](https://Amazon.co.jp). You can get delivery to (and pay at, in cash) a convenience store. Delivery in 2-3 days.

The air that blows over from China tends to leave sticky dust on outdoor things.

To protect against haze, please get N95 masks or N97, but N97 isn't readily available.","The masks that most folks in Japan wear are not rated to filter smoke and such fine particulate matter. You need a respirator. I don‚Äôt know if there is an International Standard (ISO) for respirators, but in the US, a ‚Äúparticulate respirator‚Äù should be tested and approved by the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH). It will have the words ‚ÄúNIOSH‚Äù and either ‚ÄúN95‚Äù or ‚ÄúP100‚Äù printed on it.

16s9001,A gay couple's 2-week honeymoon in Japan REPORT,"I found it incredibly useful to read reports of what people actually did vs what they plan to do so here goes a fresh take.   


1. Our 2-week trip was a bit different than what I typically see on here - we spent more time at clubs, bars, Pokemon and concerts - so I thought I might have a different perspective to share.

2. Our tolerance for touristy stuff, lines and crowds is negative 3, so here's a perspective on that.  


* Dates: Sept 10 - Sept 24
* Age: 1 couple - 30M and 42M
* Weather: HOT and HUMID
* Clothes: Tank tops and gym shorts most days. At night we sometimes work t-shirts and pants, but we were really hot walking around.
* Travel: we took trains and buses using our Suica card (love the Suica card), and bought at 14-day JR Pass. Except when we had luggage we splurged and took taxis. That little splurge really increased our level of enjoyment.  


**Day 1 (Monday): TOKYO**  


Our flight arrived to Haneda really late because we had to divert to Honolulu for a medical emergency. So we got in at 1am.

We used our Suica card and hopped right on the train to Shinjuku. We bought our JR Rail pass later at Tokyo Station and didn't have to wait in line.  


Hotel Amanek in Shinjuku  
\- 8/10. really good price, new, comfortable, nice view. Very central to all of the late night activity. The area felt like it had a good mix of locals and tourists. Got it for $85/night.  


Sushi at Yarou Sushi  
\- 5/10. it was 2am and one of few places open. Don't bookmark this one.  


**Day 2 (Tuesday): TOKYO**  


Tsukiji Market  
\- 7/10. go early! We got there at 8am and blitzed through it. Lines got really long when we left. Nothing there is worth waiting longer than 15 min for in my opinion.  
\- loved the kobe beef skewers, strawberry daifuku and mochi balls. Tamago (egg) was too sweet I thought. Seafood was good, but standing on the street in the hot sun is not how I typically enjoy eating sashimi.  
\- we only got one of everything and shared. would recommend. you'll get full.  


Senso-ji and Asakusa  
\- Super touristy stalls everywhere - we took the picture and got out. Didn't feel relaxed at all.  


Melon bread with ice cream at Asakusa Sakura  
\- 8/10. Worth the hype. Really liked the crunch soft bread with the ice cream. There was no line in the morning.  


Baby Castella („ÇÇ„Å°„Å´„ÇÉ„ÇìÁÑº„Åç ÊµÖËçâÊú¨Â∫ó)  
\- 5/10. Cute bear shaped cakes. But bland.  


Akihabara  
\- 6/10. Went to Animate for anime merch. Electric Town for video game merch. and a gachapon place. Didn't buy anything. It was fun, but nothing you couldn't find anywhere else.  


Ramen at Ramen Nagi in Golden Gai (Shinjuku)  
\- 9/10. Hidden tiny, ramen spot. Up a tiny flight of stairs. We were there at 2:30 and there was no line, but a line when we left. No frills, cash only. It was delicious and unique setting.  


Movie - The Boy and the Heron by Studio Ghibli (Piccadilly Cinema)  
10/10 -  It's not out in the USA yet. We watched it in Japanese with no subtitles. It was a beautiful experience. Didn't understand the words - but I could 'feel' what was going on. Might watch more movies in Japanese now - it was fun.  


Drinks at the Gay District - Nichome  
8/10 - we ended up making some friends at Aisotope Lounge, and we followed them to Eagle Blue where they have karaoke on weeknights. Singing karaoke we made even more friends and had a blast. We ended up seeing this friends often over the next 2 weeks.  
\- Drinks in Japan are very affordable. In Nichome everyone buys drinks at the konbini (¬•250) and then stand outside on the sidewalk and talk. Even in the club they were only ¬•700. I thought this was really cool  


**Day 3 (Wednesday): TOKYO > KYOTO**  


Ramen at Ichiran  
8/10 - the Ichiran in Shinjuku is open 24H, and we went at 8am so there was NO line. Perfect hangover breakfast. It was tasty. Its not the best ramen in Japan, but it was what we needed at the time. I like the customization options.  


Shinkansen train to Kyoto (10:30 - 1pm)  
I originally was worried that we were on such a late train, because we had a full day scheduled in Kyoto(this was the earliest train we could get that had seats available on the Mt Fuji side). But the night before was so much fun, and the train gave us a chance to recover and sleep, so I didn't mind it.  


Hotel Gozan  
8/10 - very nice and modern hotel, and walking distance to metro and the market. Ultimately I think it was a bit too far from the action. I wouldn't stay here again due to location. Got it for $100/night  


Kiyomozu-dera  
9/10 - beautiful temple complex with gorgeous views of Kyoto. The walk UP to the temple was full of tourist shops. So the crowds offset the beauty of this place a bit.  


Snoopy Cafe  
5/10 - got the chocolate shake. no flavor. did it for the gram  


Starbucks (the historic one at Nineizaka)  
10/10 for the building. Got the Osatsu Butter frapp. They are promoting it everywhere right now and its the only thing on the menu I saw that was unique to Japan. It's actually delicious and tastes exactly like a sweet potato.  


Studio Ghibli store  
7/10 - Cute photo opp, but the merch is what you'll see everywhere in Japan, including Narita. Not bad, just nothing unique to this place.  


Apple Pie Lab  
10/10 - Just up from Starbucks (like 2 doors down) is a thing called the Apple Pie Lab. They make warm apple pastries filled with custard. I don't think it's a Japanese food, but it was probably the best sweet thing I had in Japan. Absolutely delicious.  


Hokan-ji Temple  
9/10 - beautiful. but good luck getting a picture without 50 people in it. We got lucky and went down the hill a bit and got a good pic when there was a break in the crowd.  


*Kawaramachi Area of Kyoto*  


Kobe beef skewers at Gyu-Kaku  
8/10 - I think we ordered the right thing. We didn't get the AYCE, just the premium kobe beef plate. It was delicious, but nothing else that people were eating looked that great. Service was also terrible. We thought that since Gyu-kaku originated in Japan it would be better than the LA ones, but no, it's not.  


Gay bar at Apple  
6/10 - a unique experience. There were 3 people in there and we had a nice, long conversation. It was more like a bar in someone's living room. Met some nice people.  


**Day 4 (Thursday): KYOTO**  


*Arashiyama Area*  


Bamboo Forest  
7/10 - Got there at 8am and took pictures. It's smaller than I imagined it to be. The longest part was setting up the tripod. Did get one iconic shot before the crowds came.  


Tenryu-ji Temple  
7/10 - Opens at 8:30 and we were one of the first ones in. Very pretty garden. Took a few pics. Left before it got busy.  


Miffy Sakura Kitchen  
6/10 - we bought the iconic Miffy bread. Took a pic. Didn't taste great. Line was 20 min and we got there early.  


Rilakkuma Tea House  
8/10 - surprisingly delicious food for being 'cute'. and the plates were adorable. This place made a lot of people jealous on insta.  


Kinkaku-ji Golden Palace  
10/10 beauty, 2/10 crowds - we couldn't get out of there fast enough. Fake smiled for the pictures and booked it. It was hot. We were dying.  


*Nishiki Market*  


Gyoza at Kyoto Gyu-Collet  
7/10 - would recommend the lamb gyoza. Beef were just ok. Chicken skewer was great.   


Koe Donuts  
4/10 - pretty, but bland and dry.   


ÈªÑÁôΩÁôΩ jiggly cheesecakes  
6/10 - pretty moist and eggy, but bland cake. Didn't eat much of it.  


Pontacho Alley  
10/10 for ambience. We bar-hopped here, basically just going wherever there was room. We ordered high-balls and talked to the bartenders. A great time!  


Gay bar at bell  
7/10 - this is likely more fun on the weekends. The set-up was nice, but dead when we got there on a Thursday.  


**Day 5 (Friday): KYOTO > TOKYO**  
Shinkansen back to Tokyo at 8:30am  


Shibuya Tobu Hotel  
4/10 - the location was incredible, but not worth it for how run-down it felt. Got it for $100/night.  


Shopping at Shibuya Parco  
9/10 - for the Pokemon Center, Nintedo store, Namco store, street fashion shops. we had a lot of fun here.  


Shubuya Crossing - it is what it is. Got a nice pic with the tripod. Then it started raining cats and dogs.  


McDonalds to try the unique items  
6/10 for unique items. Teriyaki Chicken sando was good. The spicy chicken 'shaker' tasted like a chicken nugget with a ramen seasoning packet thrown on it. The red bean and mochi pie was pretty ok. The soy sauce burger didn't have much flavor.  


*Harajuku*  


Jordan Nike store  
9/10 - very cool store with unique merch. cool collection of Jordan clothes and shoes. memorabilia, and an immersive basketball video experience. they did a great job with this, and there are only 3 in the world (Milan and Seoul)  


Takeshita Street in Harajuku  
9/10 - cute little street with fun unique shops and food stands. nothing was crazy expensive. They have the Sanrio store and Pompompurin Cafe, a lot of cool anime shops and street wear outlets. Crepe stalls. Unexpectedly spent a good amount of time here. It was fun.  


SGClub in Shibuya  
8/10 - this place was all foreigners. So in that sense it was lame. But the drinks were really (expensive) fun. our favorite was the Tom Yum Kick - a spicy, lemongrass, gin cocktail. It was so good I went back the next night for another one.  


Gay bars in Nichome on a Friday night  
10/10 - the neighborhood was hoppin'. Bars are small so people spill out into the sidewalk and small streets. Everyone bought their drinks at the konbini and walked around with them. It felt like a block party. Once inside people were dancing. Everyone was fairly nice. Eagle Blue, Eagle, King, Aisotope were the main ones.  


**Day 6 (Saturday): TOKYO**  


Coffee at Cafe Apero  
8/10 - ADORABLE and modern spot. We just stopped while waiting for our lunch reservation. They really spent a lot of time on design.  


Lunch at the Kill Bill Restaurant - Gonpachi Nishi-Azabu in Roppongi  
9/10 - the ambiance is fire. The food we got was beautiful and tasted really good.. Loved the tar tar, shrimp dumplings, beef skewers, and the ice cream/mochi dessert  


Observation deck at the Mori Art Museum  
8/10 - the view overlooking Tokyo Tower is iconic. That's why we chose this location. The outdoor area was closed however, hence the lower rating. There was a Disney exhibit also going on which was kinda cool.  


Dinner at Omoide Yokocho (memory lane) in Shinjuku  
7/10 - the ambiance was really fun. We found 2 seats and pulled up and had a cozy dinner with 2 other couples in a cute little alley. Fun to try once, but there's better food.  


Went back to Nichome for another fun night! Stayed out way too late haha  


**Day 7 (Sunday): TOKYO**  


Fluffy pancakes at Micasadeco & Cafe in Harajuku  
9/10 - got there 10 min before opening and had one of the first tables. when we left the line was at least an hour. We devoured the pancakes (I got the seasonal chestnut ones). Beautiful and delicious. Recommend this place over Flippers, which we passed by and it didn't have near the same charm as Micasadeco.  


Music festival at Ultra Japan  
10/10 - all-day music festival at Odaiba Beach. The crowd was incredible. Music was awesome (Trekkie Trax and Skrillex!). Food was meh. This is only once a year, but this was definitely a highlight.  


Day 8 (Monday): TOKYO > NARA  
Shinkansen down to Osaka (3hrs)  


Hotel Vista Osaka-namba  
10/10 - location was steps away from Dotonburi and the metro station. Hotel was new, clean, modern, full of amenities, and only $100/night. Recommend.  


*Nara*  
30 min train right (very picturesque) from downtown out to Nara  


Mochi pounding and match mochi (Nakatanidou)  
10/10 - only of the only tourist traps that didn't have a huge long queue. Mochi pounding was cool to watch. mochi itself was only 150¬•, and it was warm, and gooey and delicious.  


Deer feeding  
5/10 - there are deer everywhere. You don't need to put deer on your schedule, they will come find you. We encountered them as we walked from the mochi pounding to Todai-ji temple. Most of the deer just sit there, but a few come up to you and are pretty aggressive. I recommend not holding anything in your hands and just walk fast. Definitely don't need to buy the biscuits...I saw anyone with biscuits either get ignored or get mobbed by deer.  


Todai-ji temple  
9/10 - stunning. 2nd largest wooden structure on earth and a huge bronze Buddha statue inside. I've seen a lot of temples, and this one is worth going to. beautiful grounds and beautiful interior. Crowds of school kids are everywhere so just try to find a break between them.  


Dotonburi  
5/10 - hot take. I think its overrated...and least on this holiday Monday evening it was. Incredibly crowded. Anywhere worth eating is over an hour wait. The takoyaki is sub-par. To me it felt like being in Times Square - sub-par food catered to tourists. We tried some mid takoyaki, took pictures in front of the Glico sign, then dipped when we couldn't find anywhere to eat.  


Chuka-soba Fuji  
9/10 - we asked a local for food recommendations and found this spot where we were the only foreigners (a good sign). Food was delicious. Soba and Ramen and delicious gyoza. Wanted to come again the next night but it was closed on Tuesdays.  


**Day 9 (Tuesday): UNIVERSAL STUDIOS**

  
6/10 - first of all. To get your Nintendo timed entry ticket you need to show up and wait in line, and get your ticket scanned to get into the park (they let people in early), THEN when your ticket is activated you can request a time. No Universal employee could tell me this, so now you all know. We showed up 30 min before it opened. Go through the gates 10 min before it opened, and were able to request a Nintendo entry time of 10:20am. So we went to Harry Potter rides first. They were both 45 min wait times. When we left they were at 70 min.  
\- Nintendo World is a nightmare. It's so cute, but way too small. There's a 20 min line to get in (even with timed entry), 20 min line to take a picture at the entrance, 20 min line to buy a wristband, 70-90 min wait for each ride, 45 min wait for the snack shack, multi-hour long wait for the cafe, and its even a 5-10 min wait for the little coinboxes so you can use your wristband. Its just lines everywhere, you feel like you can't do anything. and you can't leave because then you can't come back.   
\- we got some food at the snack shack, did the yoshi ride, bought a wristband and dipped out. We tried to do the other stuff like the cafe and the MarioKart ride, but we had already been there for 3 hours.  
\- by mid-afternoon, evertything else in the park was also an hour wait. We ate at the one-piece cafe because it was only 30 min. Jurassic Park was 90 min. Spiderman was 100 min. We did the JujitsuKaisen 4D movie (pretty cool). and took a picture with Pikachu. Then ate at the Pokemon cafe in the park. Food was mid, but cute.  
\- I hated that even the line to get a churro was at least 30 min. Just lines everywhere. It wasn't very fun for that reason.  


**Day 10 (Wednesday): OSAKA > TOKYO**  


Pokemon Cafe in Osaka  
9/10 - we unexpectedly got an opening time at the Pokemon Cafe. We showed up at opening (10am) and there were a few slots available. Very surprised and happy by this! It was adorable and we got some really cool souveniers. Food was ok.  


1pm-4pm - Took the Shinkansen to Osaka in the afternoon  


*Shimokitazawa - MY FAVORITE AREA*  


Shiro-Hige's Cream Puff's (totoro)  
?/10 - they sell out of the cream puffs by 1pm. So get there early. We got there right before closing :(   


Bonus track area  
10/10 - we walked down the path from the cream puff shop and stopped in the little cafe area near Bonus track and Tan Pen Ton. This area was the highlight of my trip. Cute little coffee shops, bakeries, record shops, etc. we bought some artisan highball drinks and sat and enjoyed the evening.  


Izakaya at Âëë„ÅøÂá¶ „Çø„Éä„Ç´„Åü„Å™„Åã ‰∏ãÂåóÊ≤¢Â∫ó  
7/10 - nice ahi sashimi and fried chicken. the other skewers were just ok. high marks since we were the only foreigners  


Hookah ShiSha @ Shisha 2  
8/10 - exactly what I wanted. laid-back hookah place surrounded by locals, and ratty couches, and manga. It was midnight and packed with people. A really fun vibe.  


**Day 11 (Thursday): DISNEYSEA**  


Things we ate:  
Sausage gyoza bun - 8/10. Delicious with the spicy sauces  
Matcha/white chocolate popcorn - 6/10. a few bites was good enough.  
Sea salt shell ice cream - 4/10. Incredibly bland.  
Long naan with beef filling - 5/10. Needed to be spicy.  
Sparkling boba drink - 7/10. Nice with the jellies.  
Toy Story alien mochis - 7/10. Very cute and pretty tasty.  
Magellen sit down restaurant - 8/10. Very expensive but a delicious meal. Probably the best food I've had at a Disney park anywhere.  


Rides:  
Journey to the center of the earth - 8/10. New ride for me. really fun, but seems it could've been better. Not themed Disney at all  
Indiana Jones - 8/10. Classic. Maybe better than the Disneyland one?  
Raging Spirits - 5/10. Fun roller-coaster but not immersive at all and not themed Disney in any way.  
Sinbad's Voyage - 7/10. Catchy song. Its like Pirates and It's a small world combined. and a movie that I don't think exists.  
Tower of Terror - 8/10. New story and they use the ride pattern from Twilight Zone so it's really good!  
Venetian Gondolas - 7/10. Unique Disney experience. They actually are pushing the boat themselves.  
Ariel's area - beautifully themed, but rides are all for kids. kind of like Bug's Life area at Disneyland.  
Didn't do nemo or soaring or aquatopia or toy story mania as the lines were crazy by then  


Overall I'd give DisneySea a harsh 7/10. It's a beautiful park. The rides are just ok. The food looks good on TikTok but mid in real life. and it just didn't feel like we were at a Disney park - nothing was Disney themed.  But high marks to the fact that Disney knows how to have enough food stalls that the lines were like Universal.  


**Day 12 (Friday): TOKYO**  


Harry Potter Warner Brother's Experience  
8/10 - overall this location is giant! I think its even bigger than the London location. Its beautifully done. We spent way longer here than we thought we would, and really enjoyed it.  


*Ikebukuro*  


Shopping at Sunshine City  
8/10 - for all the Pokemon shops and anime merch. A lot of unique stuff here.  


Ramen at Mutekiya  
10/10 - best meal of our trip. It was already a 45 min wait at 2pm so hopefully more people don't go, but it was absolutely incredible. The meat, broth, noodles all so perfect.  


Kobe beef at ÁÑºËÇâ„Éõ„É´„É¢„É≥ Èæç„ÅÆÂ∑£ Êñ∞ÂÆø‰∏â‰∏ÅÁõÆ  
9/10 - I'm a fan of this meal. The beef was incredible and they really made it very comfortable for us. Really like the staff. It was pouring rain outside and super cozy inside.  


**Day 13 (Saturday): LEAVING**  


The final day we spent getting souveniers and snacks from Don Quijote, grabbed one last ramen from Ichiran, and took the Narita Express to the airport.",https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/16s9001/a_gay_couples_2week_honeymoon_in_japan_report/,Super detailed very cool.

es0rl0,Be aware of jetlag and flight tiredness before planning your first day(s),"If you're young, energetic, know your body well, don't need much sleep or have traveled a lot already just ignore my post. I'm more concerned about people with no/little travel experience.

I'm looking at this sub and see crazy itinaries where people just arrive after a 12 hours+ flight, already get busy before getting their first meal, then think they can just go to bed, get 8 hours of sleep, wake up fresh like a daisy and the next day do 5 Tokyo areas in the morning, climb Fuji in the afternoon and party in Osaka the evening.

There's a good chance you barely slept in a dry and noisy airplane, have 8 or more hours of jetlag, won't be able to sleep well the first few nights and won't be in the mood to get packed in the subway and walk all day counting the minutes because there's still 8 things to do in your daily checklist before you're allowed to go to bed.

There's no shame to have a first day where you hang around the place you sleep, see a bit the neighborhood, check the local restaurants, buy a take away meal and enjoy it at home before you get an early sleep. 

For people coming from Europe it's also ok to sleep a bit late so you are rested. Wake up at 10 and skip the fish market breakfast, there's still plenty of time in the afternoon.

If you're old and lazy like me, give yourself 3+ light days and don't be afraid of going back to your place in the afternoon to get some rest or even a quick nap. 

Also if you're more than 3/4 days in a city, having the last day here free so you can go back to your favourite ramen restaurant, improvise, chill in your neighborhood, rest or whatever else you feel like at this moment is a good idea. 

You'll also be surprised how some places are different in the morning or evening, so going back to the one you liked the most at a different time will give you a new experience.",https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/es0rl0/be_aware_of_jetlag_and_flight_tiredness_before/,"Jet lag will really depend where you're coming from; traveling East is a lot harder than traveling West.  Flights from the Americas will travel West to get to Japan, and as long as you can keep yourself awake until evening on your first day you'll more or less be fine.  You'll be up early and down early for the first few days, but you won't feel traditionally jet-lagged, in my experience.  Basically what happens is your body perceives the travel day as one really long day and adjust accordingly because going West you gain time, and as a result sunlight, so your body basically perceives the day as ""I woke up in the morning and had a very long afternoon and went to bed at night.""

Flights from Europe, Africa, and Asia will travel East, and jetlag will be a much bigger concern.  You'll need to take measures against Jetlag and be prepared for a rougher adjustment.  Basically when you travel East you lose time and sunlight, and your body doesn't understand what is happening.  You wake up in the morning, then are awake at night, but then the night is too short and it's morning again, and your body feels like it's having the same day a second time, which you sort of are.  Your body perceives a day like this as ""waaah hgarghhhh what is happening am I time traveler the universe is broken and sleep is dead!""

By contrast, you'll have the opposite experience going back.  I'm in the US, so going to Japan is pretty easy for me, but I get pretty bad jetlag when I come home.","Mine was a 15 hour flight. We got to our hotel for 3 o‚Äôclock in the afternoon, napped, went out for tea and a couple of drinks around 7ish, then went back to the hotel and slept the night. More or less writing off our first day was an absolute win: we woke up completely fresh and ready to go early the next morning.

That said, I definitely over-crammed my itinerary. I didn‚Äôt realise just how big of a city it is, nevermind Tokyo but even it‚Äôs individual districts! Id looked at walking from x to y which sounded great in theory and didnt look far on maps, but in reality took an hour and a half, etc. I had a great time but ultimately did so much stuff I actually dont have really any memories where I just.. stopped and enjoyed the place? Rarely went for drinks, meals were actually a burden and constraint on my already over-packed schedule. I have some regrets about that... luckily I just found out I‚Äôll be able to go back to Japan in June this year! I‚Äôm going to make sure to stop and smell the roses this time.","As someone who took 13+ hour non stop from NY, didnt sleep a wink, I can attest the jet lag is real. I was fine getting through the airport...started getting tired on the cab ride, and when we got to our hotel I was dead. We took a walk to Lawsons and decided to just eat close to the hotel and go to bed...ended up being a pretty fancy Shabu Shabu place with one of the best meals of our trip...and I could barely sit up through it. I hardly remember it, i felt drunk from exhaustion.

On the other hand, the jetlag woke us up at like 5-6am every morning and we had pretty full days of activity, including the Ghibli museum on our fidst morning which included navigating the subway about an hour. Was rise and shine for us (late 20s). But that first night, forget it. Im so glad we didn't book anything for that first night.

After the second flight of no sleep, back home, we were passing out every night for a week at like 7pm. That was when the real jetlag hit us.","Guess am lucky living in Aus there‚Äôs only a 1hr time difference so we‚Äôve planned to just grab some dinner when we arrive and head to bed around our normal time of like 10 

But your right self care is always important you don‚Äôt want to run yourself down then end up sick for the rest of your holiday","I always recommend not putting anything specific on arrival day.

Like others have mentioned, going from west to east isn't bad but east to west is terrible. 

I generally suggest to try to only worry about getting to your accommodation on arrival day and maybe a bite to eat. If you decide you're up for it, once you're here *then* you can be like ""oh well we're alright, let's go see (x) before they close"" rather than being in a ""oh we planned to see (x) but we're tired, the flight was uncomfortable, we got lost getting from the airport to the hotel, it's later than we thought it would be and if we don't go now we don't have time later."" sort of situation.

Other than that, it's really up to the individual."
1iogaap,My experience leaving my phone on the Shinkansen from Tokyo to Kyoto,"Today I rode the Nozomi for the first time! It was a pleasant 2 hour and 15 minute ride from Tokyo to Kyoto. We had the seats on the back right of the cart so we had views of Mt. Fuji and space for our oversized luggage. Once we arrived in Kyoto and got ready to hail a cab with the Go app, I realized I didn‚Äôt have my phone! We went to Lost & Found at Kyoto Station and they said to come back in an hour after they‚Äôve had time to work on the situation. They filed a report and we waited the hour at Kyoto Station. 

We noticed after about 30 minutes that Find My showed my phone still being at Osaka Station, which was a great sign. We went back and they confirmed it had been found and they had a photo on a tablet of my phone! Huge relief. Luckily I still had a physical Suica from my first trip to Tokyo in 2023, as we had to head to Osaka from Kyoto to get my phone. My partner downloaded the Go Taxi app and we took our luggage to our hotel then we left for Osaka. 

Not what I expected my first trip to Osaka to be, but what can you do? We made it to Lost & Found and handed them a receipt we were given back at Kyoto Station. They brought out my phone and a beanie I hadn‚Äôt even realized I left! If I was going to lose my phone, I got lucky in where I did.

We are heading back to Kyoto, very thankful for how thorough Japan can be with things like this!",https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1iogaap/my_experience_leaving_my_phone_on_the_shinkansen/,"I once left my laptop in the Narita airport.

Fortunately the wonderful staff at the station I got off at helped me by calling the bus company, who got my phone from the bus at the next stop. Then the staff helped me get a taxi and explained to the driver where I needed to go. At the station where I picked up my phone they just had me fill out a simple slip of paper saying I had picked it up, and the taxi driver took me back to where I needed to be. When leaving the taxi, the driver smiled and told me not to forget anything in the taxi. We both laughed, and honestly, I'll never forget that guy. After all that, he gave me a laugh I really needed.",lost and found in Japan is a cultural experience.,"I found someone's credit card in Tokyo and turned it in to the police box.  I didn't expect to have to fill out my name, contact information, and where I found it but I also suspect that if I was Japanese there would have been many more boxes to fill out.  It was a fun little side quest."
17am1u6,Today I learned the hard way that I didn't get into good enough shape for this trip,"So I'm on day 7 of my 10 day trip in Japan, but had to take a break from sightseeing today since yesterday I blew out my feet and one knee.

When I booked this trip I intended it to be a reward for getting into better shape, but as the summer rolled by I only exercised occasionally. Last month I started putting 3 mile walks on a new pair of Nikes to break them & myself in for the trip, but I only did that about 10 times.

I did a LOT of walking the first 5 days of the trip and things were fine, but yesterday was the most at 8km, as I hiked across town from Kinkaku-ji to my AirBnb near Keage Station, after walking a mile or so to get to Ry≈çan-ji when they opened at 8:00.

The results was two really blistered out small toes and a right knee that hurts a lot when walking for some reason (I am 50lbs overweight now so that's the reason I guess).

So today I cut my day's activities short (I had planned to visit Inuyama and have an AirBNB booked there) and instead asked the Nagoya Visitor center for a recommendation for a walk-in clinic for my feet.

They gave me an address for a ""Sports Clinic"" that was close to the station and I grabbed a taxi from the station to get there.

When I hobbled in @ 2:00 I knew they were going to be closed for their mid-day break until 3:30 so I had to wait a bit to be seen. They didn't know anything about my GeoBlue insurance coverage so they told me I was going to pay that day instead. [TBH it was pretty fun having this hospital experience to practice my Japanese instead of seeing Inuyama, which I've seen from a distance before anyway.]

I'll cut the play-by-play short but the doctor there wrapped gauze on my left & right little toe blisters (both toes are pretty raw now) and told me to loosen up my shoes and not wear socks so I can get more air to my toes.

He ordered some X-rays on my right knee, plus for some reason a lot of X-rays of my feet. Ordinarily I would have objected since my feet were fine, bone-wise, but I knew Japanese health care was pretty cheap so just went with it. . . .  in fact the total bill for the visit was just $76.34...


**Update:** I've cancelled my trip to Atami and Shimoda today to get more bedrest for the blisters & knee in the Toyoko Inn I'm staying in.

Will try to get out in the PM to an Asics store in Nagoya to get 27cm shoes : )

I had a perfect first half of the trip in Shikoku, Hagi, and Kyoto, so missing Inuyama and Shimoda won't be the end of the world. Hopefully I can make it to Kamakura on Friday and Shibuya on Saturday! Very handy being able to book tickets online with the JR pass I got.

**Update 2:** after a nice hot bath for the knee in the morning and resting in bed until 2:00, I pulled off the gauze, put two strategic bandaids on the blisters, and called an Uber to take me to a nearby Asics Walking store:

9yxj4f,I was blown away,"I just returned today from a 6 day trip to Kyoto and Tokyo. It‚Äôs a trip that changed me. I turned 30 while on the trip and spent part of it exploring on my own. This is my first foreign trip of my adult life and first ever alone. I was apprehensive and nervous due to the language and culture differences being from the US, but doing it on my own and then meeting up with a pre-planned work related trip to shibuya was helpful for my growth as a person. I found incredible apparel, food, and accommodations. Spent some time wander Kyoto‚Äôs parks and shrines in the early morning, the tiny allies filled with vendors and stores, and then walked the drizzling neighborhoods of shibuya and harajuku during a night finding some of coolest dressed people I‚Äôve seen.

I have been intrigued by Japanese culture from a very young age; sitting at the local library on a Friday afternoon reading manga. Death Note was for me, content that sparked many thoughts and many contemplations of cultural perception, ethical perception, expectation and understanding in Japan. As I grew up, I noted many significant cultural aspects that were unique to Japan and yearned to experience it all for myself. Many books, documentaries and travel guides over the years have added to this intrigue!

I have been back home in Australia a little over a month now and have had a little time to reflect, so would love to share with you the moments and the experiences that stood out to me most:

\- ***The trains are eerily quiet*** (particularly as an Australian who frequents public transport back home); very few people will talk on train rides. I realised during my train rides two things: 1. Japanese people really value peace and quiet and don't appreciate anything breaking this calm. 2. The loud and obnoxious were always tourists, always.

\- ***The streets are also surprisingly quiet!*** People don't walk down the streets talking loudly on their phones; those who needed to make phone calls would do so discretely while standing still in a corner away from walking traffic, only taking on their path again once they have ended their call.

\- ***Alcohol is so easy to buy*** that as someone who does not speak or read Japanese, I bought a can of Shochu alcohol at a convenience store thinking it was green tea. I realised my mistake when I felt a little buzzed on the 1.5hr bullet train trip.

\- ***It is out of character for trains to depart any later than their scheduled time;*** we had one train trip in our entire time there that was delayed, fancy it being the one that took us to the airport after already running half an hour later than we intended to leave...

\- ***People do not walk and eat, or walk and drink in public***, counter-intuitive to the plethora of vending machines that are available across the country (even in the most remote of towns)! People will finish eating standing next to the vending machine and dispose of their rubbish in the bins beside the vending machines respectfully. I once saw a man throw his cigarette butt on the floor and people behind him were quick to give a look of shock. Rubbish bins are also surprisingly hard to locate outside of vending machine areas..

\- ***People eat and drink on the train***, and this is so widely accepted that some trains will even have fold out tables with drink holders!

***- The Tokyo train stations give me anxiety***, only because I travelled with 25kg of luggage and found myself in sticky situations of some stations being without escalators and elevators at many of the half-floors that would lead to the main floors and platforms, or escalators and elevators only at certain entrance/exit points that were not the ones I needed to travel through. Oh, and because I feel claustrophobic being squished into a train like a sardine in a tin. 

\- ***Service and hospitality is really big in Japan, from the smallest of ways;*** baskets underneath dining tables at restaurants for you to put your bags and belongings in, service-men in front of car parks to direct incoming/out-going traffic from the car park and let pedestrians know when it is safe to cross, hooks on certain trains for coats/hats, traffic controllers who always nod you off as you drive past, bathrooms at all of the convenience stores (outside of the Tokyo city area), hot towels to wipe your hands with at restaurants, the ""I'll try my best"" attitude at all of your requests, instead of the eye-rolls and teeth grinds that you may get when you ask for something in some other parts of the world where you're made to feel like you are inconveniencing people to do their jobs...

\- ***There was a real contrast about Japan*** \- so much of the old lives with the new; buzzing bright technology and proud and peaceful practices of centuries-old traditions.

\- ***Mountains, stunning, big, bold mountains, everywhere!*** I had no idea that volcanically active countries resulted in such picture-perfect, postcard-iconic landscapes! Holy dooly, the sights were a feast for my eyes! Waterfalls, mountains, valleys, molten lava-formed rock attractions, onsens, deep blue lakes, large gushing gorges, rich Autumnal foliage...

\- ***The array of healthy and home-made food options available at convenience stores and supermarkets*** gives me some insight into why obesity is definitely not an issue in Japan! Also, very delicious options that are rather guilt-free, coming from a fast-food laden country!

\- ***Driving was really easy***, being an Australian on the same side of the steering wheel and road, with an English-navigator GPS. The only time we ended up on the wrong lane/side of the road was when we were too busy pointing at the puppy that sat patiently with his owner to wait for the pedestrian light to go green.

\- ***Pedestrian crossings don't make sounds or need their buttons pushed to light green!*** I learned the clearly-a-tourist way that pressing the button at pedestrian crossings will result in loud tunes to signal to the visually-impaired that it is safe to cross the road..

\- ***Traditional homes have 'wet rooms' as bathrooms*** where the entire bathroom, including walls, are designed to get wet. The shower heads can always be removed from the holder so that you can shower and rinse down from the flat part of the wet room, outside of the bathtub! This was something I had to get used to, but by the end of my trip, so loved the practicality! Most wet rooms in Japanese homes also doubled as clothes dryers (there are options on the ventilation/aircon pad)

\- ***Japan is incredibly spiritual;*** shrines are scattered everywhere across cities, towns and villages, and death seems to be more 'visible' than what I'm used to - i.e. cemeteries are not hidden behind a wall of trees but presented in plain sight in most non-city areas.

\- ***Japan seem to have a really rapidly growing commitment to ethical and sustainable consumption*** \- thrift and 'recycle' stores were in an abundance!

\- ***The Japanese preserve everything so well,*** from their culture to their belongings to their structures, I was left feeling impressed at how careful and considered they are!

\- ***There is an elegant simplicity about Japan;*** from the crisp and clean interiors of traditional homes, to the beautifully-presented variety-of-small-portioned-food at meal times, to the general visual merchandising of most retail stores, to the multi-functioning bathrooms/wet rooms, to the chopstick rest.. There was such a strong presence of artisanel and well-intended craftsmanship in so many aspects of living, from cuisine to building structures, art to hospitality, cars to roads, bedding to furniture...

&#x200B;

I could go on and on really about how amazing the trip was, but I think I may have babbled some of you into boredom (if not, you are always welcomed to message me if you do have any curiousities that need quenching)! So I think I will end this with praise on how magnificent of a trip Japan was for me, and how wonderful of a place it would be to travel for anyone; from those who absolutely adore the buzzing sights and loud sounds of big cities, to those who dream about the way that the sunset paints the sky in warm ombre shades over natural backdrops in quiet and remote places (me)! There is a lot to discover, a lot to experience, a lot to indulge in, a lot to be humbled by, a lot to learn, a lot to appreciate, and a lot to be thankful for in this incredibly beautiful and distinctly unique country!

# Gahhh, would 11/10 go again!",https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/a7d12q/trip_report_i_spent_my_first_time_in_beautiful/,"Awesome post.  

This is pretty wrong:   

>Japan is incredibly spiritual     

unless you mean it feels like that for you because there are a lot of shrines and temples. It does have religious practices and influence in the culture (obviously).      

I am going to write a bit about this. Maybe because I have a very heavy background in practicing  Buddhism, and know Japan pretty well.    

Many US cities have churches all over - every few blocks. Like Japan, people don't go there much. No one would say ""The US is incredibly spiritual"" when they saw all these churches if they knew anything about the culture. Most Japanese are not spiritual or interested in religion or spiritual things. Most Japanese know little about Buddhism, for example - unless you count the new-age new Buddhist cults where you do things like pray for money.  They know more about the history of Buddhism and Shinto practices, but not as much about the spiritual sides.  

Modern cultures have spiritual roots. That's why God is a part of US culture and Shinto and Buddhism is a part of Japanese culture. In modern societies like Japan and the US few young people are interested in spirituality. Actually probably many more people in the US are interested in spirituality, and many more people (in some US states) are religious and Christian. But the US culture itself is not very religious or moral.   

Japanese people have a stronger simple moral sense and respect others for the most part. Again, compared to the US - since I live in both countries (more in the US).  

If you want to be able to say ""this country is incredibly spiritual"" go to India or Nepal or Tibet (or spend time with overseas Tibetans). Their culture is incredibly spiritual.    

I love your post, but just wanted to comment on that. Overall I would consider most Japanese people to be pretty kind and moral, but not spiritual. Young people in Japan are often not religious.  The temples and shrines in Japan are amazing though.   

Also, you write incredibly well. I really enjoyed reading your post. Thank you.","> - People eat and drink on the train, and this is so widely accepted that some trains will even have fold out tables with drink holders!

This depends heavily on the type of train.  Shinkansen, Green Cars, and certain ""Express"" trains; Yes.  Subway or local trains, it is generally not acceptable to eat (drinking can be fine in some instances).

How, my man, how?

I feel like we should reassure people: generally, there's an ""alcohol section"" at convenience stores and it'll be fairly obvious what's alcohol and what's tea. Remember one character (ÈÖí) and it'll be even more obvious - this isn't a problem you'll have to face!","Convenience store food comes from a factory in Japan just like anywhere else.

1lcil62,I sort-of accidentally ended up having dinner in a very local and authentic sushi restaurant,"TLDR; It was a bit bumpy and at times uncomfortable, but ultimately very rewarding.

I felt like a quiet dinner alone last night, so I found a highly reviewed sushi restaurant near my hotel. I was staying in the Naniwa ward in Osaka, south of the busy Dotombori area. 

To begin with it was hard to find. Google maps took me to the street on the wrong side. I walked around the building it was apparently in a few times but nothing stood out that told me it was a sushi restaurant. I eventually found this traditional, inconspicuous little building with some kanji written on the front. Google lens let me know that it had ‚Äòsushi‚Äô in the writing, so I thought this might be the place.

There was no window and no way of seeing inside. What‚Äôs more, there was an entrance way but the door into the restaurant was closed and also had no way of seeing inside. Wondering if I was going to be welcome here, I gingerly knocked and slid the door open. 

It was already dawning on me what kind of place this was. There was probably not much catered for tourists here. It wasn‚Äôt really what I‚Äôd set out for, but that was fine I thought. It‚Äôd be good to get out of the comfort zone of tourist traps, experience something more authentic and support a local business. Still, I was really quite nervous. What if I displease them by breaking etiquette? This seems like very local place where the people inside may know each other. Am I going to be welcomed as an outsider?

Anyway, I opened the door and there was a host standing on the other side. I thought he may have jumped and seemed a little surprised to see me, but that also may have just been my nervousness speaking. Another guy came over to me. There was a bit of an awkward moment where we were both waiting for the other to say something. I offered him Google translate if he wanted to speak Japanese, but turned out his English seemed fairly good so I eventually asked if I could sit. He showed me to a seat. I sat down, had a look around at the patrons enjoying themselves and quickly accepted that I was the only gaijin in the room.

The host gave me a menu. No English but that was fine. I‚Äôd memorised ‚ÄòOsusume wa nan desu ka‚Äô (what do you recommend) for such a situation and was actually quite glad I got to use it at last. He replied in Japanese, couldn‚Äôt understand but I just nodded and said I‚Äôll have that. 

The waitress served me some appetisers. They were delicious, but as I ate I could see the staff looking at me from across the counter. I imagine they were doing it in good faith, but being watched while I ate certainly didn‚Äôt help my nerves! I smiled and said ‚Äòoishii desu‚Äô and got a nice smile and a bow in return. They seemed happy to have got my approval, but they still continued to glance at me every now and then. 

The chef was very friendly and as he served each dish, he told me what it was in English. He put the first piece of sushi on an ornate black dish, sitting on a raised counter about a meter front of me. Two things weren‚Äôt quite clear to me: Will he add more sushi, or is it served one at a time? And is the black dish supposed to stay in the same place, or do I take it and put it in front of me? Maybe it was obvious to some, but my anxious brain made me freeze. I just waited to see if he would put more sushi on. But as time passed I saw the chef glancing over more, then two of the staff started talking to each other and pointing at the sushi sat in front of me! I whipped out Google translate, typed my question and got the answer easy enough. The sushi is served one at a time and you don‚Äôt take the dish. You just pick it up with your chopsticks and eat it. I hoped they realised it was just a little misunderstanding as they were all smiles afterwards. 

After that I started to relax a bit more. The sushi was absolutely amazing. It melted in my mouth like butter and combined with the wasabi, it was like each bite was a flavour explosion in my mouth! There were one or two more faux pas: I fumbled one piece with the chopsticks (still conscious they may be watching), but recovered ok. And had to ask the waitress to repeat a few times when asking for the bill. But they seemed pretty patient and understanding. I paid the bill and exchanged several gochisou sama deshitas (it was a great feast/thank you for a delicious meal). The chef came from behind the counter and bowed to me as I left. Smiles all around and seemed like everyone had enjoyed it, myself included.

My anxious brain still decides to focus on the embarrassing moments and make me cringe. But looking back on it I‚Äôm pleased for getting out of my comfort zone and experiencing something closer to the local culture. I can recommend it if you have a bit of money to spare (it‚Äôs pricey) and feel like challenging yourself a bit while on your travels.

I can certainly read the menu. That said, at good sushi places I always ask what the osusume is or just the omakase. Sometimes a younger person will answer ""It's all good.""

fpqtw2,ANA Airlines praise,"Through all the recent events of cancelled flights, uncertain travel terms and people world wide needing to cancel or update plans - many who have been unsuccessful in obtaining full refunds or credits, I just wanted to praise ANA for their response during these times. 

We were booked via an agent on the cheapest airfare possible, ANA rather than deflecting us to the travel agent we couldn't get in touch with offered an upfront full refund (not credit), however at the time we still decided to fly out. Once in Japan we had 6 amazing nights before our home country demanded people return home immediately, again after failing to get in touch with our travel agent we were able to talk to ANA at Haneda and they were able to change our return flights with no issues or hassles for no extra charge - they even asked which seats we would prefer!

I hope that when the world returns to normal and we are all traveling again, that we make an effort to choose airlines that put the customer first and go above and beyond. I just wish my own countries major carrier (Qantas) had done similar, but my friends were not so lucky dealing with them.",https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/fpqtw2/ana_airlines_praise/,ANA also treated us well! Have nothing but great experiences with them,Totally agree. We flew ANA March 3 and return March 13 and were blown away by their service.

Called to cancel my international flight 22 hours after I bought it (they said free cancel with refund within 24hrs). Waited on hold for 2.5 hours and finally got them on the phone and they refused to refund because it was after 24 hours. They even acknowledged they could see when the call was placed and that I attempted to contact them within the 24 hours but said their policy is that you have to complete the cancellation transaction within 24 hours. They said they would escalate it and contact me within 72 hours. A week later no contact, the flight has been cancelled, and there isn‚Äôt even a record that it existed on the website.

Working with my credit card to reverse the charge, but they said it can take 30 days.","ANA is often much more expensive than some of the cheaper options (Air China, Singapore Airlines) but as someone who flies ANA regularly, I can safely say the increased price correlates to better service. 

Also, ANA‚Äôs vegetarian meals and snacks are great. United, who I normally never have issues with, always gives you fucking pasta or curry."
dy4h63,"My recent two-week onsen & ryokan road trip adventure across Japan! With full recap, homemade maps, travel tips, itinerary links, and more","I‚Äôm a Norwegian dude who‚Äôs always had a deep and abiding love for Japan - in particular onsen and bathing culture. I‚Äôve done about a dozen smaller trips over the years, but this October I decided to do my dream journey.

I had such an amazing trip, and this subreddit helped a lot in the planning. I wanted to give back in whatever way I could, so here‚Äôs the rundown if any of you want to do something similar:

**THE PLAN**

My plan was to:

* Travel solo for two weeks, all the way from Tokyo to Matsuyama via Kyushu Island (Even though I speak only 4-5 words of Japanese, poorly at that.)
* Stay in a new hot spring village and ryokan every night
* And most importantly: Hit up as many ONSEN each day as I could! (My goal was to hit at least 30 - a number I almost doubled by the end. I devised a rating system - more about that later.)

[HERE](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1W1UuXiR3B55HeGCI4nSE6_mGGz9c6XMG&usp=sharing) is my map of the overall route, which went:

Tokyo - Kusatsu - Shibu - Kanazawa - Kaga (Yamanaku, Awazu, Yamashiro) - Arima - Kinosaki - Kurashiki - Kumamoto - Kurokawa - Beppu - Unomachi - Matsuyama.

If you have any Qs about any specific place, don‚Äôt hesitate to ask me!

**PS:** Typhoon Hagibis hit and knocked out a crucial Shinkansen line 3 days before I left, which was of course just a *super* fun challenge and not stressful at all.

I made homemade Google Maps of each region I was planning on visiting - as an example, [HERE](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Epi5w1dh-Z0V8vlJqwAqQ3ktv08zGDJc&usp=sharing) is the one for Kyushu Island. (The little blue waves are the baths, the beds are my ryokan!)

If anyone wants, I‚Äôll share all the maps. They were made from me reading a billion travel books and websites for months and months in advance.

Avoid Golden Week/Christmas/Sakura seasons for a lot of these villages - I think they get pretty crowded. I went off-season with many near-empty trains/buses/towns. Even in many onsen and ryokan I was completely alone - it was right after China's Golden Week, right before Winter/Christmas season, so mid-October was juuuust perfect. I still got to see incredible Autumn foliage, although that's even more beautiful right now in November.

**BOOKINGS**

I‚Äôll share a Google Doc with the full transport info at the end. I bought a two-week JR PASS from [HERE](https://www.jrailpass.com/), which meant I only spent 400 EUR total on almost all the transport total. (I also got a portable wifi from the same site - lifesaver.)

Plane tickets were around 650 EUR direct from Amsterdam where I live, thanks to [Skyscanner](https://www.skyscanner.jp/). Put up a price alert on there two months in advance.

I booked all my ryokan via [Booking](https://www.booking.com/) \- I think they‚Äôve recently added a ton more traditional ryokan, I found some real gems on there. Plus their app made it easy to have Japanese info on all lodgings, communicate directly with the property about my kaiseki meals, phone numbers to hand to cab drivers, and so on.

Lodgings cost about 80-120 EUR/night - and I had two big splurges you can see in my recap highlights at the end. (You can also stay at budget hostels in pretty much all of these places, but I was all about ryokan.) Feel free to ask about which were the best ones!

**TRAVEL ITINERARY**

[HERE is the FULL Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hSZ7EmoPSetvjncSLUQESXqfmfjWv9vm8aA7gf9sOZM/edit?usp=sharing) with all of the schedules for trains, buses, ferries, etc. I did a *lot* of research - with a few optional timings - so this is still pretty accurate for whenever other people might go. It also has all my maps.

If you make your own travel schedule, use [Hyperdia](http://www.hyperdia.com/) for longer journeys - not Google Maps. The latter is not optimised for easy travel in Japan, it will give you stupid routes that take 3x the time. I know the Hyperdia page/app does not look pretty, but trust me - it could mean the difference between a 2-hour train ride and a 9-hour one.

I almost never spent more than 1,5-2,5 hrs/day on transport. And traveling by Shinkansen and cute local trains is just so pleasant anyway, 99% of the time I wished I could stay on each train longer!

**CONCLUSION**

If you want to take it easy and stay longer in a few places, these are my personal top 5 onsen villages/cities from the whole tour (ranked in the order you‚Äôd do them in - Kurokawa is probably #1 overall):

1. KUSATSU
2. ARIMA
3. KINOSAKI
4. KUROKAWA
5. BEPPU

Finally, I made videos where I ranked each bathhouse from 1-10 while travelling, which are all gathered on my Instagram story highlights. (*EDIT: Removed due to self-promotion rule.*)

I could write a novel about all I experienced on this trip, but the IG stories and this post sorta say it all. It was the adventure of a lifetime and the best trip I‚Äôve ever taken.

Thank you so much, r/JapanTravel.

**PS!** I know it sounds like this was planned to the millisecond, but the most important thing I did was TALK to people in each village. My Japanese sucks, but people were always SO willing to share bathing and city tips, hand-draw paths to secret onsen, share meals, etc. I have a physical black dossier full of maps, memories, and notes from local villagers. So even though I've shared a lot of tips here, that book is the most precious guide of them all. :)",https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/dy4h63/my_recent_twoweek_onsen_ryokan_road_trip/,This is amazing!

‚Ä¢	Our plane to Narita was delayed because someone accidentally drove a fucking truck into it (for real), so our 5pm arrival became a 9pm arrival. Grabbed our pocket wifi, charged up our Suica cards, and hopped on the Skyliner. We got to our AirBnB in Shinjuku for around 11.30pm.

‚Ä¢	We had originally planned on exploring and finding a restaurant, but the delay meant we were too tired to do anything but grab some snacks and essentials from a 7/11 and crash for the night. (Note: this was the start of my pudding obsession ‚Äì more on that later.)

**FRIDAY 10/05 ‚Äì TOKYO**

‚Ä¢	First order of the day: Michelin starred ramen joint, Nakiryu! Arrived at about 12pm and waited in line for approx 40 mins. We each ordered the flagship tantanmen. Fantastic depth, with an unexpectedly creamy broth and a good level of spiciness. Surprisingly, though, not a big standout for me in terms of ramen I had throughout the trip.

‚Ä¢	Harajuku time! My friend hadn‚Äôt been before, so we swung through Takeshita-dori and did a bit of shopping. Loaded up at the Stylenanda and Innisfree stores on some of my fave South Korean skincare and makeup products. It was a weekday, so crowds were mild (but no cosplayers out). Friend isn‚Äôt a big shopper, but was happy to follow me around and take in the sights.

‚Ä¢	Ate lunch at a cute little dessert shop, Milk Craft Cream Caf√©, which my friend had heard of. The ice cream was incredibly creamy and cheesy.

‚Ä¢	Went out that night to Anata no Warehouse, an arcade themed after the Kowloon Walled City. Was super cool, but only the first floor really retains the theme; second and third floors are much more traditionally arcadey. Rad place nonetheless.

**SATURDAY 11/05 ‚Äì TOKYO**

‚Ä¢	We found an absolute banger of an unagi place on Tabelog: Akasuka Fukinuki. We opted for the hamanako unagi (four seasons eel). Hamanako means you eat the eel four separate ways - plain with rice, then with shallots added, then with shallots and nori added, and finally with shallots, seaweed, and eel broth all mixed in with the rice. This was INCREDIBLE and in my top 3 meals.

[Unagi 1](https://i.imgur.com/jsY7drp.jpg) | [Unagi 2]( https://i.imgur.com/AyhvlDb.jpg)

‚Ä¢	We then hit up Shimotikazawa, which is a little boho neighbourhood that features tonnes of second hand shops and crafts stalls. Very cute area. Bought some handmade jewellery.

‚Ä¢	Ate at Flipper‚Äôs, because you gotta try fluffy pancakes in Japan. A lot of people say the pancakes look good, but don‚Äôt taste like anything (or just taste like egg). Disagree vehemently. Pancakes were delicious, and yes, quite eggy ‚Äì but I love egg. Their milk bubble tea sucked though, as the tapioca pearls weren‚Äôt soaked long enough. 

[Pancakes](https://i.imgur.com/GQOxg9Y.jpg)

‚Ä¢	Hit up Golden Gai in the evening and got smashed with a couple of locals. Bit too smashed. At a certain level of drunkenness, sake goes down like water. Golden Gai is gorgeous, though we were a bit disappointed that the one bar we really wanted to hit up (Death Match in Hell) was closed. 

**SUNDAY 12/05 ‚Äì TOKYO**

‚Ä¢	Our original plan was to go to the Fuji Shibazakura festival, but we were still a little toasted from the night before. Stayed in and napped until about 1pm.  

‚Ä¢	Desperately needed carbs, so headed to Ramen Mutekiya. This was probably the ramen joint I was looking forward to most before the trip, and it PAID OFF. Ramen is my favourite food, and Ramen Mutekiya is hands down the best ramen I‚Äôve ever had. The meat was like butter. Tonkotsu broth was rich and deep. My friend opted for the ¬Ω pound charsiu ramen, I opted for the standard bowl. Go out of your way for this place - getting teary just remembering it.

[Standard Mutekiya bowl](https://i.imgur.com/22udK0c.jpg) | [1/2 lb bowl](https://i.imgur.com/xsYUkrm.jpg)

‚Ä¢	Wandered around Shinjuku with no concrete plans. I‚Äôm a big Godzilla fan, so we went to check out the Godzilla head. Cool, but we arrived too late to see the light and smoke show. Did a bit of shopping, played a few claw machines (won nothing). 

‚Ä¢	Still feeling full from Mutekiya, so for dinner we opted for a bit of yakitori. We were lazy and just Googled ones with a decent rating, so ended up at a pretty touristy/expensive spot with a cover charge that we were too awkward to back out of. The yakitori was still yum, but lesson learned and we took the extra time to use Tabelog for the rest of the trip.

**MONDAY 13/05 ‚Äì TOKYO**

‚Ä¢	Tsukiji fish market (the old one). Lots of snacking: otoro, scallops grilled in butter, squid skewers, tamago skewers, octopus cups. We ordered omakase at Sushi Sei Honten; it was delicious, but I made the mistake of snacking too much beforehand and didn‚Äôt appreciate it as much as I would have. Standout of the market was an incredible matcha latte made with syrup and cream. My favourite drink from the trip - just the right level of bitter and creamy. I immediately regretted not getting another to go after we left.

[Sushi Sei Honten](https://i.imgur.com/rQT7N4T.jpg) | [Matcha Latte](https://i.imgur.com/054M9oI.jpg)

‚Ä¢	Team Borderless! Loved it. The atmosphere is unlike anything I‚Äôve ever experienced before. My favourite part of the whole exhibit was the caf√© ‚Äì I won‚Äôt spoil it, but it‚Äôll blow your mind. Get the ice cream and tea set. Only major drawback was the sheer length of the lines. DON‚ÄôT line up for the ‚ÄúNest‚Äù experience if it‚Äôs very long ‚Äì while lying on a giant net is is cool, you see the exact same light show at the Cave sans the queue.  

‚Ä¢	Went back to Shinjuku to try and catch Godzilla‚Äôs light show this time. That was cool, but only worth it if you‚Äôre a big fan. 


‚Ä¢	Did a bit of browsing at Shibuya 109, a fashion mall aimed at young women. Cool area, lots of cheap, cute, one-size-fits-all clothes. I‚Äôm fairly thin so clothes were fine, but shoes were a lost cause (size 8 Aus shoe size).

‚Ä¢	Dinner was spontaneous tonkatsu at a restaurant in a department store. I don‚Äôt remember the name, but as with almost everything else this trip, it was delicious. 

[Tonkatsu]( https://i.imgur.com/1pbisS9.jpg)

**TUESDAY 14/05 ‚Äì MATSUSAKA**

‚Ä¢	Caught a combo of Shinkansen and regular trains to Matsusaka, a city known for producing the best beef in the world.

‚Ä¢	Ekiben! We got three to share for the trip: a variety bento, a seafood bento, and a beef bento. The beef was so tender and juicy.

[Ekiben](https://i.imgur.com/z70vPpX.jpg)

‚Ä¢	Got all fancied up and went to Wadakin, a restaurant famous for their Matsusaka beef sukiyaki and amiyaki. We ordered one set each (to the tune of ¬•16,700 and ¬•17,700, respectively). Absolutely phenomenal. The best beef I have ever tasted, and the experience was near reverential. The beef just melts. Neither of us are particularly well off, but we saved up specifically for this and consider it 110% worth it.

[Wadakin 1](https://i.imgur.com/SklP6LS.jpg) | [Wadakini 2]( https://i.imgur.com/KLi0cqd.jpg) | [Wadakin 3](https://i.imgur.com/7zxz4SZ.jpg)

‚Ä¢	Hit up a couple of bars afterwards. Fancy glowing cocktails to end a fancy night!

[Cocktail](https://i.imgur.com/o6uwLxu.jpg)

**WEDNESDAY 15/05 ‚Äì ISE AND KYOTO** 

‚Ä¢	Someone here recommended that, while we were in Mie, we should go to the little township of Ise and hit up the Akafuku teahouse and try their mochi. I am SO glad we did, because this day stands out as my favourite day the whole trip.

‚Ä¢	Ise is a little township approx. 40 minutes outside of Matsusaka. Beautiful mountain views, woodlands, and gorgeous old architecture. Akafuku is a historical teahouse that‚Äôs been serving the exact same mochi for over three hundred years. The mochi and the teahouse were both beautiful.

[Ise township](https://i.imgur.com/iesIVST.jpg) | [Akafuku Teahouse](https://i.imgur.com/6UKlvlh.jpg) | [Akafuku Mochi](https://i.imgur.com/RBMk57V.jpg)

‚Ä¢	There was a market on in the area! As Ise is a little out of the way, most people at the markets seemed to be Japanese with a small smattering of tourists like us. We wandered and snacked on stall food for hours. Had a light soba for a refreshing lunch.

‚Ä¢	We unfortunately had to leave mid-afternoon to get to Kyoto before our AirBnB check-in closed. I would absolutely come back to Ise again.

‚Ä¢	AirBnB in Kyoto was fantastic, with tatami flooring, shoji doors, tonnes of space, and a central located. An absolute fucking steal for $900AUD (620USD) across 5 nights. The only drawback was that my friend, who is 6‚Äô3‚Äù, smashed his head against the doorframes a total of 9 times during our stay (which honestly was kind of another benefit for me, because hearing a muffled *CROMF* ‚ÄúFUCK!‚Äù at 2am is hilarious). 

‚Ä¢	We were pretty dead after walking all day, so phoned it in that night and grabbed some ramen from a nearby Ichiran. Was my friend's first time eating at an Ichiran. Good for if you just want a quick fix o' carbs.

**THURSDAY 16/05 ‚Äì OSAKA**

‚Ä¢	Left at 10am for Osaka, but trains were delayed for over two hours due to a fatal track accident. That was pretty sad. Kyoto Station was thrown into a bit of chaos so English announcements understandably fell to the wayside, but we were eventually able to find the alternate train.
 
‚Ä¢	First thing we hit up was Osaka Aquarium, which was pretty cool. The whale shark tank was awesome, as were the emperor penguins. Good way to kill 2 hours or so.

‚Ä¢	Headed out to Dotonbori and grabbed some okonomiyaki (an Osaka specialty) and omusoba from one of the restaurants lining the river. Delicious, very filling, and fun to eat. 

[Okonomiyaki](https://i.imgur.com/nSjeQq8.jpg) | [Omusoba](https://i.imgur.com/ylmBQaI.jpg)

‚Ä¢	Ate some kobe skewers, squid skewers, and takoyaki. The main street of Dotonbori was absolutely PACKED so we retreated to the quieter back streets, which had very urban hip vibes.

‚Ä¢	Fashion is a lot different in Osaka than Tokyo ‚Äì less cutesy/classy, more grunge and hiphop influenced streetwear. The shops reflected this and were v. cool, albeit expensive. 

‚Ä¢	We went to World‚Äôs Second Best Freshly Baked Melon-pan Ice Cream, a famous melon bun stall which has now set up a permanent storefront. It was DELICIOUS, an excellent combination of hot and cold, and far and away my favourite dessert in Japan. Strongly recommend opting for the matcha ice cream. 

[Melon Bun Ice Cream](https://i.imgur.com/muJ3LQE.jpg)

‚Ä¢	Finished out the night at the ‚Äúhidden‚Äù bar, Bar Nayuta. Very cool, dark atmosphere with a secret entrance and a tiny door you need to stoop under. You‚Äôre also unlikely to find any locals here, as it‚Äôs definitely a tourist bar and quite expensive. Stayed for a drink each and dipped.  

**FRIDAY 17/05 ‚Äì KYOTO (KIBUNE AND KURAMA)**

‚Ä¢	Put on our best walkin‚Äô shoes and caught the supercute Maple Leaf Train to Kibune. 

‚Ä¢	Kibune is a super quaint little mountain village. Beautiful old houses, stunning views, a river winding through the main street, and shrines everywhere. VERY popular tourist destination so we didn‚Äôt bother looking for authenticity and just popped in at Hirobun. Hirobun is known for their flowing noodles, but we opted for the kawadoko kaiseki (kaiseki served on flooring placed over the river). Such a tranquil experience.


[Kibune](https://i.imgur.com/I0IGipt.jpg) | [Hirobun 1](https://i.imgur.com/vRT4uiD.jpg) | [Hirobun 2]( https://i.imgur.com/rVag14Y.jpg ) | [Hirobun Kaiseki 1](https://i.imgur.com/dFdgGZ2.jpg) |  [Hirobun Kaiseki 2](https://i.imgur.com/854SHnm.jpg) | [Hirobun Keiseki 3](https://i.imgur.com/G2KrkZW.jpg)

‚Ä¢	We then did the hike from Kibune to Kurama, another mountain village. The hike is lined with temples and shrines along the way, and took us about 2.5 hours. Very beautiful little trip, and quite peaceful ‚Äì there weren‚Äôt terribly many people around. I‚Äôm fairly sure I saw a monkey, but not 100%. (I at least saw something with a very monkey-like butt scamper behind a shrine).

[A more populated stretch of the hike](https://i.imgur.com/zF9fu6v.jpg) | [Kurama](https://i.imgur.com/k2KvErT.jpg)

‚Ä¢	Most websites have you go from Kurama > Kibune, but we did Kibune > Kurama so we could finish the day at Kurama Onsen. Kibune > Kurama is also more downhill, so slightly more merciful on our legs.

‚Ä¢	Kurama Onsen was great after several hours of non-stop walking. This was my first onsen so I needed a bit of help figuring things out, and was definitely a bit nervous about being naked around strangers, but the nerves disappeared the second I stepped into the hot spring and took in the mountain views. Most other visitors there were also foreigners, so I didn‚Äôt really stand out. Came out feeling as smooth as a seal.


‚Ä¢	Took the 30-minute train back to Kyoto and finished the night at Kura Sushi, a ¬•100 sushi train chain where for every five plates deposited down your booth‚Äôs chute you get a chance at winning a little prize. Sushi was decent, esp. for the price.

**SATURDAY 18/05 ‚Äì KYOTO**


‚Ä¢	Headed out to Nishiki Markets for (obviously) the street food. Quail egg-stuffed octopus, seafood skewers, dango, more dango, fish tsukudani, skewered fish cakes, onigiri, matcha ice cream, and matcha parfaits were had. The matcha ice cream at the main matcha store in Nishiki Market is incredible ‚Äì we got the second heaviest concentration, which was the perfect blend of bitter and sweet for us.

[Octopus](https://i.imgur.com/ZODKLEJ.jpg) | [Parfait](https://i.imgur.com/Gb3pTkI.jpg)

‚Ä¢	Swung by the Kyoto Manga Museum. I‚Äôm not super into manga, but still really enjoyed it. The museum has a massive library of manga in all different languages that you can just grab and pop down in various reading spots with. Lots of manga history, beautiful drawings, etc. An eye in the storm after the mad crowds at Nishiki.

‚Ä¢	Dinner was Okariba, a rustic little wooden smokehouse about twenty minutes out of the main city area. We ordered the grilled boar, boar tataki, smoked duck loin, horse sashimi, wild nametake, charcoal grilled salted trout, grasshopper tsukudani, and ‚Äì naturally ‚Äì some sake. Standouts were both styles of boar, the grasshoppers, and the trout. The boar was gamey (in a very good way), robust, and rich. The trout was perfectly salted, skin crispy, and the flesh tender and juicy. Grasshoppers were sweet with a satisfying crunchy texture.

‚Ä¢	Finished the night with an assortment of 7/11 snacks back at our apartment (although I could barely fit anything in!). 

[7/11 Snacks](https://i.imgur.com/IXrxaKO.jpg)

**SUNDAY 19/05 ‚Äì KYOTO**

‚Ä¢	Kichi motherflippin‚Äô Kichi. My friend and I have been desperate to eat at this place for years. You need to reserve in advance, and the seats book out in minutes, so the relief when we got our reservation was palpable.

‚Ä¢	And it was INCREDIBLE. Chef Motokichi is entertaining as all get out, and obviously extremely skilled with a pan. He served my omurice ‚Äúsuper flying style‚Äù, in which he flips the omelette out of the pan and onto the rice where it then splits itself. That being said, watching him slice open the omelette on each patron‚Äôs rice was one of the most beautiful things I‚Äôd ever seen.


‚Ä¢	The omurice was, obviously, delicious and I will cherish it always. The standout for me, however, was actually the beef stew ‚Äì a stew served with extremely tender beef in a concentrated broth made out of the same stock used in the omurice beef sauce. Overall, everything I expected it to be.

[Kichi Kichi omurice](https://i.imgur.com/lY2b9Vi.jpg) | [Kichi Kichi beef stew](https://i.imgur.com/HAh6kQ8.jpg)


‚Ä¢	After Kichi Kichi, we swung by Kyoto Tower (more out of a sense of obligation than anything). The views were nice, but I have a feeling I‚Äôd have enjoyed it more if I went at night. 

‚Ä¢	From there, we rented bikes and cycled out to Kiyomizu-dera. The temple was unfortunately under renovation and covered by tarp, but the area was still lovely and very humbling.


‚Ä¢	From Kiyomizu-dera, we biked to Gion and ‚Äì specifically ‚Äì Hanami-koji street. I‚Äôd been here before, but it was my friend‚Äôs first time in Kyoto so I thought it was important he see the area. It was as beautiful as ever, especially at night. We were lucky enough to see three geisha/meiko, which felt pretty magical. This area has a fantastical atmosphere I‚Äôve never felt elsewhere.

‚Ä¢	We then Tabelog‚Äôd food nearby and wound up at a yakiniku place called Ishiya. They gave us a grill, a plate of kobe, a cube of lard, some condiments, and away we went. Mouth-watering beef that just exploded with flavour.


[Yakiniku beef](https://i.imgur.com/Pm9Y3AJ.jpg) | [Yakiniku grilling](https://i.imgur.com/elYquA3.jpg)

‚Ä¢	We grabbed after-dinner dinner at a CoCo Curry House (delicious curry chain) and spent the rest of the night biking around the backstreets of Gion, and eventually alongside a canal ‚Äì complete with grazing deer! - back to our AirBnB. This was another of my favourite experiences; strongly recommend overnight bike rental in Kyoto.

**MONDAY 20/05 ‚Äì TOKYO**


‚Ä¢	Back to Tokyo! We returned our bikes and took our sweetass time selecting four (!) ekiben for the Shinkansen back.

[Ekiben](https://i.imgur.com/qlq0OTa.jpg) | [Close up of pink one](https://i.imgur.com/NiPVnNU.jpg)

‚Ä¢	We went to Akihabara with a joint mission of finding some One Punch Man merchandise. We only ever saw the same two figures amidst an endless sea of One Piece and Dragon Ball merch, but it was still fun to browse. I liked pointing out the super risqu√© figures for the sole purpose of embarrassing my friend. I also found a Cowboy Bebop stand, which was super exciting for me, but it was unfortunately sold out of almost everything.  

‚Ä¢	We tried to hit up the Eorzea Caf√© but didn‚Äôt realise until that you need reservations at least one day in advance. We went to the Honey Toast Caf√© instead, where we ordered this beautiful monstrosity. Inside the loaf are smaller cubes of bread. It was awesome.


[Honey bread loaf](https://i.imgur.com/iq8o9hE.jpg) | [Honey bread loaf guts](https://i.imgur.com/X5HECqP.jpg)

‚Ä¢	We then downed some takoyaki and Magikarp taiyaki and made our way to Sanji Ramen, which was unfortunately closed early. Instead went to a nearby tsukemen place we found on Tabelog called Meshokudo Isshintei. Very hole-in-the-wall and buzzing with the locals. The meal was lovely and unpretentious, and with a surprisingly complex seafood (I think) broth.  

[Magikarp taiyaki](https://i.imgur.com/URYEjT8.jpg) | [Meshokudo Isshentei tsukemen](https://i.imgur.com/g01geLF.jpg)

‚Ä¢	Closed the night out by getting destroyed by my friend in Street Fighter at a nearby arcade, and then hitting up a Don Quijote for last minute souvenir shopping. Also picked up/restocked some skincare and beauty classics (Biore Watery Essence sunscreen, Kikumasamune lotion, shitloads of Hada Labo Gokujyun Premium lotion, Kiss Me Heroine eyeliner). Swung by Sensoji on the way home, which was beautiful at night ‚Äì listening to the giant lanterns creaking in the midnight winds was something else.

**TUESDAY 21/05 ‚Äì TOKYO**

‚Ä¢	Absolutely pissing down rain, but like that‚Äôs gonna slow our roll. We swung by Sanji Ramen as soon as it opened, and I‚Äôm so glad we tried again because it was oishii as fuck. Second favourite ramen I‚Äôve ever had, and that‚Äôs a surprisingly close second to Mutekiya. Garlic and crab based broth served with extra firm noodles (my favourite!), quail eggs (!!), and some delicate slices of fatty charsiu (!!!). We were also given an extra little dish of crushed garlic to optionally mix in with the broth, which my friend did. The extra garlicky broth was unfff, but I opted to not add any to mine.


[Sanji Ramen](https://i.imgur.com/zy7Jy92.jpg) | [Sanji Ramen quail eggs](https://i.imgur.com/VZjLFkf.jpg)


‚Ä¢	We then headed to Kappabashi to check out the fake food sample shops. I had originally planned on purchasing a bowl of fake something (I already have a ramen at home), but was feeling pretty light in the pantaloons at this point so opted to mostly just browse. Picked up a couple of food keychains and magnets for family and friends back home.

‚Ä¢	Next stop was Michelin starred onigiri joint, Onigiri Asakusa Yadoroku. We shared a set of three onigiri, opting for the pickled plum, ikura, and salted squid guts fillings. My favourite was the plum and his favourite was the ikura (which was surprisingly sweet). The salted squid was extremely salty, and we suspect more of an acquired taste (and we have fairly accommodating palates). Fantastic onigiri with perfectly sticky, fluffy rice. 

[Michelin onigiri]( https://i.imgur.com/Rbf5A1k.jpg) | [Ikura onigiri](https://i.imgur.com/M8g4mui.jpg)

‚Ä¢	Swung by a Uniqlo and a caf√© to escape the rain for a bit, then back to Sensoji temple and the surrounding markets. Munched some taiyaki, crispy chicken skin, and another melon pan ice cream. 

[Taiyaki](https://i.imgur.com/62sNw7X.jpg) | [Melon Bun](https://i.imgur.com/oGC0HlC.jpg)


‚Ä¢	Airport time. We bought five puddings for the road (to stave off withdrawals for as long as possible). We were absolutely soaked from the rain and I got to spend the next 24 hours looking homeless in various planes and airports.

---

Overall, a defining experience that I will never forget. Those twelve days in Japan were some of the happiest in my life, and my friend and I have already started planning our next trip in two or three years‚Äô time (Hokkaido, we‚Äôre comin‚Äô for ya). Happy to answer any questions y‚Äôall may have!

**General food tips:**

‚Ä¢	Puddings. We became OBSESSED with the little pudding cups you can get at konbini. We got at least one each day we were there. We tried every variety, but in the end [this one](https://i.imgur.com/tkSPNTL.jpg) emerged the victor (with Ohayo brand pudding coming in second). You know how good dessert used to taste when you were little? Yeah, this is that taste again. 

‚Ä¢	‚ÄúOsusume onegaishimasu‚Äù gets you places. Menu all in Japanese, and waitstaff don‚Äôt know any English? Osusume. Overwhelmed by options? Osusume. Just interested in what the chef/waitstaff recommend, but don‚Äôt wanna go full omakase? Osusume.

‚Ä¢	‚ÄúGochisosama deshita‚Äù for when the food really blows your socks off and you need something more than just ‚Äúarigato gozaimasu‚Äù. 

‚Ä¢	Strongly recommend Tabelog. Tabelog is the Japanese equivalent of Yelp, and you can assume anything above a 3.5 is fantastic (anything above 4 stars is often Michelin starred). Excellent website for finding where the locals eat. Restaurants with high ratings on Tripadvisor etc ‚Äì i.e. popular with tourists - were often rated comparatively lowly on Tabelog. Just don‚Äôt expect English at the restaurants you find (osusume, osusume, osusume)!",https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/bs5m11/trip_report_12_days_in_tokyo_kyoto_osaka/,Holy shit as someone who has been checking this sub weekly for things to do on my trip in December I've yet to see a report as detailed and clearly written as this one. Even with pictures which helps me choose where to go. I REALLY appreciate this trip report!,Wow loving the food recommendations! Looks like you all had a wonderful trip. I‚Äôm definitely going to try the unagi and Michelin starred onigiri! (Who would have thought?),"Great write-up! My husband and I are total foodies with just a few days left in Japan. I'm bummed that we won't get to visit a bunch of these places before we leave, but I'm definitely saving this post to plan future trips. 

&#x200B;

Btw... I believe we sat next to you guys at Kichi Kichi on Sunday! (I asked if you guys were from the states lol). If it is you, I'm glad we met and got to enjoy that omurice together. That ""flying style"" omelette was sweet!",[removed],"Wow, nice write-up, makes me miss Japan even more. Your descriptions made me hungry."

**This post will be updated as time allows as the storm approaches. Please also watch the comments section for distinguished (green) comments from other /r/JapanTravel moderators, as moderator /u/laika_cat is located in the typhoon zone and might not be able to update the post directly.**

Super Typhoon No. 19 (aka Typhoon Hagibis) a is currently making its way toward Central and Eastern Japan. Current predictions have the storm passing directly near the Kansai area around 10am JST on Saturday, Oct. 12. The storm is currently projected to pass directly over Tokyo and the Kanto region between the evening of Saturday, Oct. 12 and the early hours of Sunday, Oct. 13.

**This storm is currently projected to have destructive winds as high as 60 m per second when making landfall.**

**Chiba, Tokyo, Kanagawa, Saitama, Yamanashi, Mie, Shizuoka and several other prefectures will be affected by this storm at varying degrees of intensity.** Please familiarize yourself with your location and which prefecture(s) you are currently in.

The outermost bands of the storm are projected to affect weather in cities such as Kyoto, Osaka, Kobe and Nagoya. Cities such as Tokyo and Yokohama, as well as towns on the Izu peninsula should brace for a direct hit from the storm.

Projections show the storm may weaken as it reaches land ‚Äî but please note that this storm will still be **extremely** powerful, even as it weakens slightly. Currently, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center is categorizing this as a Super Typhoon.

An [NHK World report](https://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/en/news/20191009_29/) from 3pm JST this afternoon (Weds. Oct. 9) states Typhoon No. 19 was situated near the Ogasawara islands, boasting gusts of 270 kilometers per hour.

**If you are near the water in the Kanto, Chubu or Kansai regions, please seek higher ground and stay indoors as the storm approaches.** Do not attempt to go near water during this storm, or you will risk severe injury or even death. Note that landslides are always a possibility during storms of this nature.

**IMPORTANT!!** This is typhoon season, and storms like this are par for the course. However, projections indicate this storm will be much stronger than Typhoon Faixai, which severely damaged parts of Kanagawa and Chiba prefectures. Please take extra precaution this weekend.

You can find individualized advisories for your respective location in each prefecture by clicking the links above. This will require knowing which city or ward you're located in. (ie: Kobe-shi, Naoshima-cho.)

Please keep in mind that while typhoons are not uncommon in Japan, you should still take precautions while you make your way around as a tourist:

- **Always follow the instructions of all emergency management officials and emergency responders.** You can use Google Picture translate for translating things you cannot get in English, such as signs and screenshots of emergency alerts.

- **Stay away from beaches, lakes, rivers and other sources of inland water, to avoid being affected by flooding.** This is particularly important for areas of Chiba, Kanagawa, Shizuoka, Mie and other areas near the ocean. See advisory links above.

- **Be aware that Typhoons can cause damage to train lines, flight delays, and affect roadways.** If you have to leave Japan from an airport in Eastern Japan (ie: Narita, Haneda) Friday or Saturday, you may want to plan on arriving to the airport early to avoid being stranded. Review your flight information with your airline in case of cancellations. If you would prefer to stay in the city, make arrangements beforehand as last minute bookings could become unavailable as the typhoon presses into the country.

- **Contact your embassy/consulate if you require consular services or emergency assistance.** If you are planning a trip abroad, remember to register with your consulate/embassy on arrival, if you haven't already done so.

**Common Questions**

1. **I was contacted by my hotel and they are evacuating/evacuated. What should I do?** You should re-adjust your plan to avoid the evacuated areas. Always follow the recommendations of officials from the prefecture you are visiting.

2. **Is my train canceled?** You will need to use one of the resources under ""Useful Links"" to determine if it is cancelled or not. If it is, find a safe place to stay until the trains are running ‚Äî but be aware this may several hours or days, depending on the severity of the damage to the lines. Research alternate transportation now, and possibly look into cutting your trip short.

3. **Should I cancel/alter my plans?** You'll have to determine this for yourself, but it's always recommended to err on the side of caution. Keep a close eye on the forecast at least, and set a firm line on when enough is enough.

4. **Is there any way out of XYZ location?** If trains are not running, other options include buses and taxis. It is also recommended to contact your hotel as they may be able to provide assistance in getting out of certain areas. You can also contact your Embassy for assistance ‚Äî but be aware that you will not be the only person attempting to do so. Coming up with a contingency plan now could make or break the rest of your trip.

5. **What should I expect?** Conditions will vary by area, but generally, expect high winds and heavy rain. Serious conditions, such as landslides and flooding, are **very rare** in cities and are more likely to affect rural areas. These storms pass quickly, but the winds can knock down trees and scaffolding, damage umbrellas and shut down train lines. It's best to stay indoors until the storm passes.

6. **Seems cool! I'm in the city, so can I go outside?** NO. Do NOT go out in a typhoon, if at all possible, under any circumstances ‚Äî especially once the storm makes landfall in your area. People are regularly killed during major typhoons, even individuals in cities. Aside from the obvious fatal possibilities associated with landslides and floods in rural areas, individuals in cities can very easily be killed by flying or falling debris, such as scaffolding, signage and tree branches. During Typhoon Faixai in Sept. 2019, a woman in Tokyo was killed when a large gust of wind blew her into a brick wall. Being in a city is NOT a surefire way to avoid serious injury or death during a typhoon.

ct0hwa,Write-up Of My Top 10 Meals During My Golden Week Stay,"This might be a bit late, but I wanted to share anyways.  This is an update to my top 10 post I made last year during my January trip.  You can find the first post here: [LINK](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/7x1if7/my_top_10_favorite_meals_album_of_everything_else/).  During the first trip I spent 2 weeks, traveling to Osaka and Tokyo.  However, this time I only spent one week and the entire duration in Tokyo during Golden Week, as I spent my first week in Hong Kong.  A lot of time was used experimenting during my first trip, so the second time around was conducted with much more intent and direction.  Planning began about 3 months prior to the trip as many of these locations required a reservation.  I‚Äôll try to include as many tips as possible in this write up, feel free to leave any question you may have in the comments. I will answer every single one.

&nbsp;

During this trip, I exclusively used Tabelog to select my restaurants.  I‚Äôm a strong believer in following the ‚ÄúWhen in Rome‚Äù principle.  Given that Tabelog reviewers are all from locals, I wanted to eat wherever they were eating.  Yelp and Tripadvisor are great for finding information about a restaurant since all the reviews on Tabelog are in Japanese.  But other than that, reviews on those sites were all from foreigners who are not acclimated with Japanese cuisine.  

&nbsp;


**Honorable Mention : Sisiliya** | [IMAGES](https://imgur.com/gallery/sVt07SI)

&nbsp;

Sisiliya was one of the restaurants I was looking forward to the most, given it‚Äôs high Tabelog rating at the time(3.97, since been downgraded to 3.83).  I made a reservation to Sisiliya about 2 months in advance on the restaurant website, but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs necessary to make one that far ahead.  Located in Yokohama, I made the trip from Tokyo just to try a slice of the second highest rated pizza in all of Japan on Tabelog.  However, this was the only time I felt let down by the Tabelog rating.  While the ingredients were great, the pizzas felt undercooked and a bit soggy.  I ordered two different pies: one buffalo cheese Margherita and one sausage.  If you take a look at the picture of the Margherita, the crust on one half does not possess the same amount of char as the other side.  The bottom of the crust was also a bit soggy.  The buffalo cheese was very delicious as was the sauce, but having a soggy pizza is almost a deal breaker for me.  I guess it's a matter of preference.  Still good pizza overall and I would recommend this place to anyone visiting Yokohama.

&nbsp;

**10. Motenashi Kuroki** | [IMAGES](https://imgur.com/a/s1o8QIr)

&nbsp;


Though not the tastiest bowl I‚Äôve had, Motenashi Kuroki had one of the most unique ramen I‚Äôve tried.  Most well known for their Shio(salt) and miso based ramen, this restaurant has some of the most unconventional toppings when it comes to ramen( Chicken stuffed with olive, leeks, dumplings, etc.).  They also have specialties depending on the day.  Because it was a holiday(Golden Week), they decided to serve a shoyu based duck ramen.  Unfortunately,  this also caused the wait to be unbelievably long.  I waited about two hours before I got to eat.

&nbsp;


The noodles were about medium in terms of chewiness, typically I prefer a bit of bounce.  The wonton skins were extremely soft, seemed almost overcooked but still tasty.  I believe there were also a couple pieces of rare duck inside which were very tasty.  I was excited to try the duck based broth as my all time favorite meal in all of Japan (Moeyo Mensuke read my previous post) was a duck based broth.  While tasty,  the broth here just lacked the pizzaz that Moeyo Mensuke possessed.  The only thing I did not like about the bowl was the amount of leeks, with each bite containing at least one leek.  The leeks were interwoven in between the noodles and were impossible to avoid.  While I do like leeks, it was just too much for me.  Overall a great bowl of ramen, and I‚Äôd love to come back and try their usual shio or miso based broth.  The olive stuffed chicken looked really unique and I was bit disappointed that I did not get to try it.  However, I do not think this bowl was worth the two hour wait at all.

&nbsp;


**9. Tsujihan** | [IMAGES](https://imgur.com/a/FVH4ODW)

&nbsp;


Delicious sashimi bowl at an amazing price.  For only around 1100 yen, you can score a sashimi don containing salmon roe, tuna, fatty tuna, squid, clam and shrimp.  Out of all the restaurants on the list, I felt Tsujihan was the best value.  You can also choose to add uni or crab at an additional cost, but I chose to stick with the base meats.  All of the fish is mixed together and placed on top of the rice in a glorious ball.  At the end, you are given a couple slices of sashimi which is then mixed with soup and rice.  Not sure what the soup consisted of, but it was also very delicious.  While the sashimi was not top tier, it‚Äôs the absolute best you can get for that price.  The restaurant‚Äôs atmosphere was a bit tense, as no one was talking at all during the preparation, but this may be due to the crowd at the time.  I got to the restaurant maybe a 20 minutes before opening and was seated as soon as the operation started.  There was a line as I was leaving so I‚Äôd suggest you try to arrive prior to opening

&nbsp;


**8. Yakitori Uno** | [IMAGES](https://imgur.com/a/2l7M6u5)

&nbsp;


One of my favorite Japanese cuisines to indulge in here in Los Angeles is yakitori.  But surprisingly, I did not try any yakitori spots during my prior trip.  I made it a mission to try at least one spot during this trip.  I went down the list of the top rated yakitori restaurants in Tokyo and had my credit card concierge call each one until I could find a reservation.  The reservation was made about two weeks in advance to my visit.  The restaurant does not have an english menu, so make sure you do your research beforehand.  Also, the staff does not speak much english so be prepared for that.  


&nbsp;

Part of the beauty of eating yakitori is being able to try parts of the chicken you wouldn‚Äôt normally order.  In my opinion, these unusual cuts are my favorite.  At yakitori spots in Los Angeles, I always order chicken hearts as this is my favorite type of skewer.  At Yakitori Uno, I tried everything from chicken thighs to arteries.  My favorite pieces were Tsunagi (part that connects liver to the heart), Bonjiri (tail), and Seseri(neck).  All of the other pieces were really good too, but for these three I ordered a second round.  Take a look at my pictures to see all of the skewers I ordered.  In the end, I was extremely satisfied to be able to try so many different and unique cuts that we usually don‚Äôt see in LA.  However, I felt it was only marginally better than the best places here.  I am a huge fan of the smoky and charcoal taste imparted on the skewers, and Yakitori Uno was a bit lacking in that department.  All the meats were still cooked to perfection and extremely delicious.  Maybe my expectations were just too high.   

&nbsp;

**7. Ramen Kai** | [IMAGES](https://imgur.com/a/Bp6LsnJ)

&nbsp;


I had originally planned to go to Tomita‚Äôs second branch as I really wanted to try a good Tsukemen restaurant during this trip.  Upon arriving to Tomita about 30 minutes early, there were already about 100 people in line ahead of me.  I had made plans to meet up with a friend in the afternoon, so after realizing I would not be able to make it in time, decided to look up another restaurant.  I just happened to stumble upon Ramen Kai as I was browsing for restaurants closer to where I was meeting my friend.  I made the decision solely based on the Tabelog score, not knowing the base for their ramen broth.  Upon arriving, I waited in a short line of about 5 people, and was quickly seated within 5 minutes.  After asking the hostess, she told me that the broth base was made of clams and sardines.  I was extremely excited as my favorite ramen broth of all time(Konjiki Hotogisu) was a clam based broth.  


&nbsp;


I decided to order the Tsukemen version of the broth with extra chashu.  Everything about the meal was extremely solid.  The noodles had the perfect amount of bounce, the chashu was very tender, and the broth was very flavorful.  I could definitely taste the sardines, but did not really get much of the clam.  The seafood flavor was amazing, but I felt it was a bit too salty and heavy.  Usually Tsukemen broth is a bit heavier than usual since it‚Äôs supposed to act as somewhat of a dipping sauce for the noodles.  But this was a bit too much for me; my lips were quite dry afterwards.  If they toned down a bit on the salt and made the consistency a bit thinner, I think it would have been the perfect bowl of ramen as the seafood taste was amazing.  Maybe next time I‚Äôll try the normal ramen instead of Tsukemen.

&nbsp;


**6. Sushi Kuni** | [IMAGES](https://imgur.com/gallery/7CVmsY3)

&nbsp;


Uni and Ikura over rice, what more else can I say.  These are probably two of my favorite seafood items.  Located in the Tsukiji Market, Sushi Kuni offers probably the best valued Uni bowl you can find.  For only 3500 yen, you get a very generous serving of Uni and Ikura.  If you‚Äôve had uni before, you are probably familiar with it‚Äôs very high price tag.  Especially for good quality uni.  For me, there is a very thin margin that separates good uni from bad uni.  It usually is either tastes amazing and sweet, or it tastes like gym socks that have been steeping in the sea. I usually take the risk whenever I get the chance, as the reward is well worth the risk.  Luckily, Sushi Kuni was on the delicious side.  While not the best I‚Äôve had, this Uni had none of the foul ocean odor, and was even a little bit sweet.  This is probably the dish that I have missed the most as it is very difficult to find Uni bowls in Los Angeles at a fair price.

&nbsp;


**5. Fukamachi** | [IMAGES](https://imgur.com/a/7Jzx6Gq)

&nbsp;



Fukamachi is an upscale tempura restaurant that specializes in an omakase course.  The operation, run by a father and son duo, has been one of the most popular tempura restaurants for years.  The team decides on the best ingredients based on season and availability, forcing patrons to trust their judgement.  My brother had tried this restaurant during his one year stay in Japan and said I had to try it.  He told me that the vegetables were incredibly tasty, and he definitely did not lead me wrong.  I am not a big veggie eater, but this was one of the only places where I prefered the veg dishes over the meat.  Reservation was made 1 month in advance, but I think it could have been made a week or two prior. 


&nbsp;


In total there were about 5 meat dishes(prawn(2), prawn heads(2), cuttlefish, conger eel, silago), 5 vegetable dishes(asparagus,broad beans,tara bud, butterbur, bamboo shoots), seafood(clam) soup, dried fish appetizer, a pickled vegetable dish, a small tempura don(prawn,scallop), and a dessert, coming out to a total of 10,000 yen.  This option is only available during lunch, and during dinner the prices increase significantly.  To me, it seemed lunch was a much better value.  On your table, you are given a tempura sauce mixture(soy-sauce based), salt and lemon.  Upon receiving each dish, you are given instructions on which of the condiments to use with each piece. This was something that I really appreciated as I would have had no clue on which ingredients to use.  


&nbsp;


Each piece was battered perfectly.  When you eat tempura here in the states, each piece is usually coated in a heavy layer of batter, completely covering the base.  At Fukamachi, the batter is light and transparent, allowing for the base to be visible. Although the batter was light, each piece was still perfectly crispy.  Each piece is deep fried in the best quality sesame oil found in Japan, which is changed frequently.  During my attendance, I noticed the oil was changed once.  


&nbsp;


My favorite pieces were the conger eel and the broad beans.  Eel is one of favorite dishes, and the eel here was extremely moist.  The broad beans were my favorite of the meal, I have never had broad beans before and now I am hooked.  It‚Äôs difficult to describe the taste, but the texture  was similar to edamame just mushier.  They even look like edamame, but are much tastier and full of umami.   The butterbur and tara bud were other vegetable dishes that I had never tried before either but were extremely tasty.  I loved that the butterbur was slightly bitter, but it may not be for everyone.  Both of the vegetables are seasonal. 


&nbsp;


There was not a single piece that I did not like, and eating here taught me the beauty of tempura.  It is seemingly simple, being just deep-fried fish and vegetables.  It requires true dedication to finding the best ingredients in order to get this cuisine right.  In this regard it is very similar to sushi.    Would absolutely recommend Fukamachi to anyone looking to experience a premium tempura experience.

&nbsp;


**4. Menya Shou** | [IMAGES](https://imgur.com/a/cdunYFx)

&nbsp;



Menya Shou was a ramen restaurant that I had visited during my previous trip to Tokyo.  Because I lived in Shinjuku this time around, coming to Menya Shou was only a short walk away.  After checking into my hotel, this was the first restaurant I visited.  It took just one bite to remind me why I fell in love with the country, particularly the food.  Shio ramen is my favorite style of ramen, and this place does it just right.  While this ramen did not possess any characteristics that truly distinguishes it from other ramen, it does everything right.  The broth was of the perfect salt level and very easy to drink after the noodles were gone.  The noodles and chashu were perfect, I prefer my noodles with a little bounce so this really hit the spot for me.  It might be a matter of preference(since Shio is my fav), but Menya Shou was definitely my favorite ramen during this trip.  Check out my previous post for more ramen recommendations, I think the ramen selection was a bit better than this years.

&nbsp;


**3. Spicy Curry Roka** | [IMAGES](https://imgur.com/a/UnvqaRn)

&nbsp;



Spicy Curry Roka is a small little shop that embodied everything great about Japan‚Äôs food culture.  The patrons are diehard foodies; I waited at 7AM just to get a spot to come back at 12PM(store opens at 11).  An extremely sweet lady runs the operation by herself, well at least during operating hours.   It took about 2 tries coming back here before I figured out how the reservation system worked.  The owner can speak english, and was very helpful and thankful that I came back after failing the first two times.  After speaking to a patron who waited in line with me, i found out that she used to work at Yoshida Kare, one of the most legendary curry restaurants in Tokyo.  She‚Äôs also a diehard curry fanatic(makes sense right?), who has traveled to Taiwan multiple times to study spicy curry.

The day that I visited, they had a special extra spicy curry.  The shop can only fit about 8 people at a time, and only one other patron opted for the extra spicy version.  She gave me a warning beforehand that it most people cannot handle it, which was a great sign for me.  I absolutely love spicy food, and I mean spicy to the point where I am sweating.  After taking the first bite, it was no surprise that she gave the warning.  My nostrils were immediately cleared and I felt the pressure in my head.  The other patron sitting next to me was drenched in sweat about halfway through.  I too began to feel the beads of sweat rolling down my forehead.  It was absolutely glorious.  Not only was the spice level perfect, the curry itself was extremely flavorful.   Saltiness was perfect, but the blend of spices/ingredients was sublime.  There was bits of beef inside the curry as well as on the side.  The beef i felt was a tiny bit overcooked, but still very tasty and a great complement to the curry.  If the beef was cooked perfectly, this would very likely be the top pick of the list.  


&nbsp;

At the end of the meal, I decided to purchase 5 boxes of her own instant curry blocks to bring home.  I could not get enough of it.  After chatting with the store owner for a bit, she bid me farewell and was extremely grateful that she had a customer all the way from Los Angeles.  Oh and did I mention the meal was only 1000 yen?  The entire experience was one of the highlights of my trip.

**2. Hakkoku** | [IMAGES](https://imgur.com/a/LagUJeC)

&nbsp;



I do not eat omakase sushi often in Los Angeles, as I feel most of the places here are far too expensive for what you get.  And it makes sense, there is not an abundance of raw fish suppliers in the US so prices are much higher.  After coming back from my last trip, I was kicking myself for not trying an Omakase experience.  Much like with my venture with Yakitori, I made it a goal to try a top tier sushi restaurant in Japan.  I went down the list for the highest rated restaurants and attempted to get reservations at each one.  I finally hit when I got to Hakkoku.  


&nbsp;


I had heard about Hakkoku before after watching a video from Mark Wiens‚Äô youtube channel.  While he did not eat the Tokyo restaurant, the head chef held a pop up in Thailand where he was able to attend.  Chef Hiro was formerly the head chef at Tokami, another legendary sushi restaurant.  Known for having a wide variety of fish due to his extensive connection, Hakkoku serves up a whopping 30 pieces, and that number increases if you include the small appetizers served before and during the meal.  I thought this was the best restaurant if it was going to be the only, since I got to try such a large variety of fish.  

&nbsp;


I did not get a seat at Chef Hiro‚Äôs counter, but instead got to sit with Daichi-San on the third counter.  There are three different counters at Hakkoku, each seat about 6 patrons.  While it would have been ideal to sit at Chef Hiro‚Äôs counter, you are still eating the same fish that is served at his counter, the only difference being the timing and preparation. I thought Daichi-san did an amazing job, serving up what has to be the best sushi meal of my life.  Albeit I have only had about 5 total omakase experiences in Los Angeles, this completely blew the competition out of the water.  Each and every piece was insanely delicious.  There were cuts that I was trying for the very first time such as firefly squid, mantis shrimp, fat greening, cherry hybrid salmon, rudderfish, surf clam, blackthroat seaperch, etc.  Some of these fish I had never even heard of before. 

&nbsp;


I felt the rice really set Hakkoku apart from other restaurants.  Because a blend of different vinegars are used, the rice has a brown color.  It just works so amazingly well with every single piece of fish.  After binge watching videos on the best restaurants in Tabelog, it seemed most of the top sushi chefs agreed that the rice is the most important ingredient when it comes to sushi.  The fish only acts as a topping.  I finally came to understand that concept after eating here, the rice was unbelievably good.

&nbsp;


My favorite pieces would have to be the Uni, Aji, Hotaru Ika, ankimo, and kohada.  The meal also came with the full array of tuna (lean,medium fatty, fatty, marinated) which was great, but lacked the wow factor that these other pieces possessed.  The Aji was incredibly meaty, this was probably the piece that stuck with me the most.  Just looking at the picture of it makes my mouth water and brings back so many good memories from the meal.  The Hotaru Ika was extremely unique; it was incredibly sweet.  Ankimo is another one of my favorites, and the piece at Hakkoku was by far the best I‚Äôve had.  It was very creamy and fat, kinda reminiscent of foie gras but without the duck aroma.  The Uni, while not the best I‚Äôve had, was still insanely sweet and creamy.

&nbsp;


Service at the restaurant was the icing on the cake.  The server, Angie, was extremely attentive and very sweet.  She sparked up a conversation with all of the patrons, seeming to genuinely care about everyone‚Äôs dining experience.  After the meal, I stayed back and chatted with Angie and Daichi-san, who invited me to get drinks the next day.  They shared their experiences of working in a sushi restaurant.  Hearing their stories really made me appreciate the experience even more as I found out just how much work goes into crafting the ultimate dining experience.  

&nbsp;



**1. Seirinkan** | [IMAGES](https://imgur.com/a/pjj6T4n)

&nbsp;



I apologize in advance for having pizza as my number one selection, but I have absolutely no shame in making this decision.  Pizza is one of my favorite foods, and prior to this trip I went on a Keto diet so I was dying for a slice.  You hear a lot about Japan having great pizza, and I didn‚Äôt doubt it one bit.  For a country that fetishized food so deeply, I think you can find great food from just about any type of cuisine.  I learned about Seirinkan through a popular video posted on Eater‚Äôs Youtube channel.  Of course I had to check Tabelog first to see it was the real deal.  I had also planned on doing some shopping in Naka-Meguro so it fit perfectly into my schedule.

&nbsp;


I arrive about 30 minutes early thinking there would be a line, but there was no one there.  Shocking, as most restaurants rated 3.7 and above usually have a line.  Also since it was featured on Eater, I was almost certain I‚Äôd have to wait.  I take a quick walk, buy a beer at a nearby convenience store, and arrive back about 15 minutes early to wait in line.  One of the staff notices me waiting outside and decides to open up early, leading me into a seat on the top floor.  The decor is very unique, reminding me of an old warehouse or factory.  

&nbsp;


I decide to go with the classic margherita as it is one of the only two items on the list, with the other being marinara.  The pizza arrives relatively quickly, and I immediately dig in with my fork and knife.  Seirinkan‚Äôs pizza does not come cut, so I divide it up into individual, holdable slices.  I am immediately blown away by the crust/dough.  Perfectly crisp and amazingly tasteful without being too salty.  Usually the middle of the pie is the soggiest, but this one was crispy throughout.  The crust tasted amazing on its own as well. I would come back just to eat the dough without the sauce and cheese, which were both also amazing.  The mozzarella and tomato were extremely fresh and flavorful, while not overpowering the dough. They were the perfect complements.

&nbsp;


I heavily contemplated ordering another pie, but had to resist as I was meeting with friends later that night for food and drinks.   If that were not the case, I absolutely would have ordered another.  I recognized the chef from the Eater video as I exited the restaurant, and  immediately bowed and praised his pizza.  I told him it was the best pizza I have ever had, and his face just lit up.  This is what chefs in Japan live for.  They do not care at all about monetary gain or fame, they just want to make their patrons happy.  And this is why I love Japan so much.",https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/ct0hwa/writeup_of_my_top_10_meals_during_my_golden_week/,This was so informative and well-thought out!

Thank you for the thoughtful and informative write up, will add this to my future itinerary.

cael7q,Just arrived in Japan and a couple things I would do differently (especially in Summer),"1.	Please please please bring more T-shirts and shirts. I was trying to be more minimal and fucked up. Have 6 tees but would prefer 10 because I sometimes change tees in the day
    P. S I brought deodorant but don‚Äôt forget that
    
    2.	when you get to airport, fuck claiming the JR pass. Line was like 40 mins. Buy an IC card from a machine (KIX airport has ICOCA) or better yet have it delivered to your home with JR pass. Claim JR card from your local JR station

3.	my thighs were chafing and it hurts :( if you have trouble with this do some preventative care. Talcum powder or something
4.	Oh and I fucked up not ordering a SIM/pocket wifi online. Handle that shit. It‚Äôs a hassle doing it after leaving the airport

1f8tyho,Shima Onsen Sekizenkan (Studio Ghibli Ryokan) Report and Tips!,"Ryokan are a popular recommendation in Japan but can be difficult to find info on or book as an English speaker. We just got back from a trip earlier this week and I wanted to put together a guide/review of our experience at Sekizenkan, which seems to be popular on Instagram since the oldest building is one of the inspirations for Spirited Away. I will go into DETAIL so hopefully this is helpful to someone else planning their trip!

  
**1. BOOKING**

I booked directly through their website (https://www.sekizenkan.co.jp/) and had no issues. There are 3 buildings: Honkan (bare bones rooms), Sanso and Kashotei (full service). We booked in the Kashotei as I wanted dinner to be in our room and not in the dining room.

Booking through Japanese hotel websites is never fun or intuitive... but it's not the worst site I've used. You will pay PER PERSON since it includes breakfast and dinner, so make sure to have the right number of people from the start!

Booking online has you pay at the hotel at checkout, so no expenses upfront.

  
**2. GETTING THERE**

We were staying in Tokyo so this is where I'll start to give directions. I went to a JR ticket office in person after I arrived in Japan to make the booking, though you could probably book online (I have no experience with this). The train you will want is the Kusatsu-Shima Limited Express train. This train has all reserved seats so I recommend booking in advance since you can't just walk on. This train leaves from Ueno station so make sure you are there on time! The platform is in the area with the Shinkansen tracks, ask for directions if needed.

You will get off at the small station Nakanojo. There you will get on a bus (there is only one bus stop) to get to the stop Shima Onsen, which is the end of the line. The bus schedule aligns with the train schedule so you will get on the bus immediately after getting off the train. When we were there, the bus driver was at the exit making sure everyone from the train got on the bus that needed to, so don't be afraid you will miss it. You will have no time (and there are no convenience stores) at Nakanojo, so make sure you have all the drinks/snacks you want for your stay before you get on the train in Ueno.

Get off at Shima Onsen station (last in the line) and Sekizenkan is just up the road. You can take your luggage there for them to hold on to if you get there before check in.

  
**3. THE TOWN**

Shima Onsen is a super tiny town and felt a little like a ski town in offseason when we were there in late August. It's probably more busy at other times of the year, but there is still not really much to do or see in the area. There were a couple spots near the hotel open for lunch so we stopped at one since our bus got us there around 12:30 PM after taking the 10 AM train. The hotel also has a cafe but it's closed on Fridays. There are some bridges with good views of the river that you can wander to. We didn't find any public foot baths like you might find in other onsen towns, but there is a foot bath at Sekizenkan if you want to use that as you wait.

  
**4. CHECK IN and THE ROOM**

We were sitting at the hotel cafe when the front desk receptionist came in and told us our room was ready. Sekizenkan has 3 main buildings that are all connected by elevators, but it can be really confusing. The receptionist gave us a laminated paper with step by step instructions and photos to get us to the Kashotei check in desk.

At the check in desk, they sat us all down and gave us tea and went over the room, meals, baths, etc. One disappointment was that although our booking said dinner was to be in the room, they reassigned us to the dining room for dinner. I asked why and they didn't really give me an explanation. Maybe because we were foreigners they thought the dining room would be more comfortable? The tables in the rooms are the traditional low height where you sit on the floor, but the dining room has Western style tables. If you have trouble sitting on the floor definitely request the dining room.

The room keys are literal keys, so make sure to lock your room when you leave. It will not lock automatically.

Another person showed us to the room and gave us a rundown of where everything was. There was a basket for each person with a towel in it and a Yukata, belt and socks for each person. Go ahead and put these clothes on because it's what everyone wears in the hotel. If you need a different size yukata, you can get one at the desk. They are sized based on height.

In the standard rooms, the main tatami area will have a table and chairs. While you are at dinner (if in the dining room) or after dinner, they will put the table away and bring out the futons for sleep. So don't be worried if you don't see anywhere to sleep at first!

  
**5. THE BATHS**

The best baths were the outdoor ones on 5F of the Kashotei building. To go to the bath, first prepare your basket and make sure to bring a towel! There will not be towels in the bath for you. Don your yukata and socks and head to the 5th floor. There is some water and iced tea in the bath lobby for you if need, then enter the women or mens bath. I am a woman so I'll walk you through that side.

When you enter, take off your slippers and attach a numbered clip that is provided. This is how you know which slippers are yours, since they are all identical. The toilet is directly after, so use it if you need. Then enter the prep room/locker room? Not sure what to call it. But there is a shelf for you to put your basket on here. Pick a spot and take off your clothes and put them in the basket. Yes, all your clothes. You will be completely naked for the baths. Put the towel on top so you don't have to dig for it later with wet hands.

After undressing, make sure you have a hair clip or hair tie. You can't have your hair hanging into the bath water, and you can use a shower cap as well (provided in the little bin on the counter). There are also hairbrushes in the little bin on the counter if you need, and there is a used brush area on the counter as well for you to put it in when you are done.

Next, enter the bath area. After stepping through the door, the showers will be directly on your left. There are stools, buckets, and a removable shower head for each station. There are also toiletries provided so you don't need to bring shampoo, conditioner, body wash, face wash, etc. Wash up at the station (I didn't wash my hair every time but I washed my body every time). When you are done, rinse off everything with the shower wand including the stool you sat on.

Then you can enter the bath! There is an indoor bath in the room with the showers, or the super nice outdoor bath is out the door to the right. Make sure your hair is up and contained in a clip or shower cap! Then enjoy the bath for as long as you like :)

Once you are done, head back inside to the locker room area. Grab your towel from your station and dry off. There are chairs and hairdryers at the counters if you need to use them. Otherwise get dressed again in your yukata and socks before leaving the baths.

I think because we are in the Kashotei, they gave us a password for the lounge in the Sanso building. If you have access then head there after your bath. They have popsicles in the freezer, cold drinks in the fridge, tea and coffee in the lounge. If you don't have lounge access, there is an ice cream vending machine in the hallway outside the 5F Kashotei baths that you can use for something cold.

We used the baths constantly, once every 2 or 3 hours or so while we were there. Each dip was only 15-20 minutes apiece. 

  
**6. MEALS**

Meals in the Kashotei were elaborate kaiseki type dinners. We went to the dining room for our meal at the time they booked us for (there were a few slots to choose from). The menu is set, there is no ordering. If you don't like something you can just have them take it away, no hard feelings or anything. Food was traditional fancy Japanese food, I can post pictures and a menu later.

Breakfast was in the lounge room near the check in counter. It was also a big tray of food that was standard for each person, plus you got to choose a smoothie flavor and if you wanted rice or porridge. All the food was pretty good and I didn't have any complaints!

For snacks, there is a small shop near the check in counter. There are NO convenience stores in town but there are some small grocers that may have something. For drinks, there are some vending machines in the hotel and in town that have beer and lemon sours, etc. But I just recommend bringing what you want from Tokyo. There is a fridge in the room so you can put the drinks you brought in there.

  
**7. HOTEL GROUNDS**

The hotel had some areas to explore and a stamp rally if you want, but there weren't any facilities other than the baths and formal dining areas. They do light up the front of the hotel every night until 9:30 PM so you can go out and take a really beautiful photo of the old building. Definitely don't forget to do this!!

Other ryokan I've been to have had a karaoke lounge, bar, or room with ping pong etc, but this ryokan was more basic. It looked like there was a pachinko parlor in town but we didn't venture out to see if it was open, so entertainment is limited here.

There is a small museum room that also has autographs from Hayao Miyazaki so make sure to take a look at those before you leave!

  
**8. CHECKING OUT and TRAVEL BACK TO TOKYO**

Check out was at 11. We waited as close to time as possible so we could get more bath trips in (our feet were so sore by this point in our trip!). They held our luggage at the front desk again as we went into town for some lunch. The bus left Shima Onsen at 12:40 PM so we killed time until then.

The bus arrived at Nakanojo station at 1:20 PM ish and the Kusatsu-Shima train stopped at 1:29 PM for us to get on. We got off at Ueno station at around 3:30 PM and continued our trip from there.



  
Overall we had a great time! The outdoor hot springs were lovely, the food was good, the rooms were very nice, and the hotel had alot of charm. I think next time we will go back to a onsen town with a little more going on (we liked Gero alot more) but I'm very happy with our stay.

I hope this was helpful!

Train and bus info checks out! The tip for the Limited Express train was perfect, I was able to book on Klook.
The town is quiet and it was exactly the level of chill I was hoping for. However, as I mentioned, I booked a hotel less than 15 min from Sekizenkan and walking back after dinner one night was almost too quiet. It seems like the Shima Onsen area offers a handful of outdoors-based activities in the summer.",

If I have any extra time any of the days I would like to take the Tokyo Cruise ferry and/or visit Odaiba

Is there anything I'm not saving enough time for?

Am I missing any important stuff? I decided not to go to Disney this time, maybe next time. And I'm not interested in teamLabs.

Thank you!",https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1fcmpnc/last_minute_itinerary_check_10_days_in_tokyo/,"This is mentioned in this sub a lot but Tokyo definitely starts a little later in the morning than other cities I am used to. I have always found some coffee shops/ breakfast sports open before 9am but that doesn‚Äôt seem to be the norm

I also like shopping in harujuku more than ginza but that is a personal preference. I like their second hand shops in harujuku and always buy a few dope sweaters or purses.","So refreshing to see a single-city deep-dive itinerary! I think it looks pretty great. Obviously, you've got a lot of things on there, but from other replies you've made in the comments, it's good to hear you'll be flexible to adapt it once your feet are on the ground..

Some thoughts/comments:

* have you read up on the process? buy your shuinjo book in advance; and I still flubbed this a few times, but I believe you should try to present it when you go to the desk, as you pay. If they only sell the paste-in sheets, they will let you know; it's better to have them put the shuin directly in your book
* big thumbs up to Yanaka/Nezu Shrine! That whole area was a big highlight for me. It was a very different kind of Tokyo.
* Shimokitazawa - trendy ""bohemian"" neighborhood (famous for music venues and vintage shops); only a few train stops away from Shibuya
* sounds like you are doing Enoshima and Kamakura in a single day? FWIW, I took a day trip to Kamakura, and really enjoyed the town..heck even the approach to the town from the train station. I ended up so absorbed with the temples and cemeteries on my way to the Daibutsu, that I didn't make it to the Daibutsu in time (it closed at like 5pm!) It was a very big self-facepalm.. I'd encourage an early start so you can have enough time to satisfy any desire to explore a bit.

Onsen - any interest? any plans? I didn't make it to any in Tokyo, but identified a few prospects: I read the new senkyaku banrai at Toyosu market ""brings in"" Hakone water (how, I don't know); but also found a natural spring hotel near Asakusa (Onyado Nono), and a nice traditional bath house near Kamata named Hasunuma.. My criteria was natural spring water (not just tap). I'm sure there are other options, but those are what I was able to find.

I ultimately didn't make it to any in Tokyo due to limited time, other priorities, and the fact that I'd already been to a decent number in other locations. One of which was Atami, which might be another day-trip idea to hold in reserve.. It's a noteworthy onsen town (with many options), it's directly on the Shinkansen, so you can get there very easily in about a half hour (and since you're sticking to Tokyo, that would give you a chance to squeeze in a Shinkansen ride!). Like Kamakura, it's also a beach town, so if you want to walk on the sand, you can do that (this was a wish-list item for one of my traveling companions ""I'm on an island, there should be a beach""). It has an old Showa vibe. When I was there, I visited the plum garden (still beautiful even pre-season) and the Jikkokutoge observatory for a Fuji view. It's still not as close as you'd get from Hakone, definitely has a major cloud risk..but it also has an amazing view of the Izu peninsula to the south. That said, the bus ride to get there was like 30-40 minutes. I did it as a last-minute addition to the plum garden after checking out from our Ryokan (with a goal to be done before dinner time), so it's definitely possible for a day trip, but maybe a little ambitious.","[1] Ueno and Akihabara are close to each other so if you want you can plan an itinerary with the two of them in mind. (Maybe Ueno in the day, then Akiba in the late afternoon to evening). Also Ueno has the National Museums. Sure about not checking them out? [2] I‚Äôm just curious, what‚Äôs your reason for wanting to check out so many shrines? Is it for religious purposes? I think if you want to go shrine-hopping, there‚Äôs always Kyoto to visit next time :D [3]Since you‚Äôre visiting Ginza, you sure you won‚Äôt stop by Tsukiji Market in the morning? [4] Depending on weather conditions, Mt. Fuji might be visible (as long as no rain, and usually in the morning). Fuji is a nice place to go shrine-hopping too. [5] Personally I‚Äôd cut Ikebukuro for something else‚Ä¶Why not Disney Sea? Or (this is personal bias), the prettiest city in Greater Tokyo, Yokohama? [6] Just a suggestion, why not reserve a dedicated shopping day? I feel like you might take too much time out of sightseeing and enjoying the vibes in an area if you have ‚Äúmust shop now‚Äù in your head. Maybe that‚Äôs just me though.",[removed],
1fb08hp,Trip Report - Oct/Nov/Dec 2023 - Sapporo to Kyoto,"I am admittedly a bit late with this trip report. As I sat at my desk reminiscing about the trip I decided now is better than never.

To preface, this trip was me and my sister with a second sister joining around the midpoint. The goal was following the fall colors from Sapporo to Kyoto. I used [this ](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1ermgvc/trip_report_nov_dec_2023_tokyo_kyoto_osaka/)post as some inspiration for formatting.

I'd love to do a day by day report but it would literally be like 15 pages long.

# Cities Visited in chronological order with summaries added to save space:

  
**Haneda Airport**  - Kawasaki King Skyfront - 1 Night 

* A lot of people recommend not staying near Haneda and instead going straight to Tokyo, I think it's definitely a time thing. If you have the time, stay near Haneda. The plane ride is exhausting, we hopped out and were in a Hotel within 20 minutes of leaving the airport. For us it was a question of stay near Haneda or fly straight to Sapporo, we were *definitely* glad to have stayed one night.

**Sapporo** - Villa Koshido Odori - 5 Nights

* I don't know if Sapporo is really underrated but it can't be overstated how nice it is. It may be my favorite city we visited, and I am not even really sure why. It has big city vibes without being overwhelming. It's laid-back but there is still plenty to do. Susukino is very busy at night, if you're looking for nightlife you wont be disappointed. I can't recommend Sapporo enough. A few places we went and really enjoyed:
   * [Moerenuma Park](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e5313.html)
   * [Odori Park](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e5301.html)
   * [Mount Moiwa](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e5309.html)

**Otaru** - Hotel Torifito - 1 Night

* Otaru was very enjoyable and was somewhere we wished we had gotten a second night. It's beautiful, great food, and just relaxing. The canals were very nice, especially at night. We had some of the best Sushi we had in Japan here.

**Hakodate** - HakoBA Hakodate - 2 Nights

* Hakodate was nice. It's a beautiful city with some fantastic attractions. Outside of the well-known views, there's not a lot to do. Also, I know this is very hypocritical, but this is the first time we noticed fellow tourists being frustrating. Before this there were very few tourists and nothing that stood out. Here there were a few instances of tourists being arrogant or disrespectful. Nothing super egregious just noticeable. Either way, I can recommend Hakodate for a short stay. Highly recommend checking out Mt. Hakodate, A few of the nice things in the area we visited:
   * [Mount Hakodate](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e5354.html)
   * [Fort Goryokaku](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e5352.html)
   * [Morning Market](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e5353.html)
   * [Red Brick Warehouses](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e5357.html) 

**Aomori** - Super Hotel - 1 Night

* Aomori and Akita were specifically picked because of the Resort Shirakami. With that said, we were pleasantly surprised by how much we enjoyed Aomori. We especially enjoyed the Nebuta museum and the morning market. I think it was my favorite of the seafood markets, and possibly my favorite breakfast. 
   * [Nebuta Matsuri](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e3755.html)
   * [Furukawa Fish Market](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e3758.html)

**Akita** - Richmond - 1 Night

* We didn't have much time in Akita so I don't have a lot to say about Akita specifically. I really liked the design of the Station however. Instead I will take this point to talk about the Resort Shirakami. It is definitely in the top 3 things we did in Japan. Many of the views were downright breathtaking, It was almost 5 hours long, from 1PM to 7PM ish. The last hour or so was after nightfall. It really was amazing. Fall is definitely the off season so the train was pretty much empty. This was fantastic, except the bar was closed which was a bit of a letdown. I know I've said this a couple of times throughout this report but I really can't recommend it enough if you can be in the area at the right time.

**Morioka** - AirBNB - 1 Night

* We didn't pick Morioka instead we picked the AirBNB and it happened to be in Morioka. With that said, like Aomori, we enjoyed the city for sure. The downtown area was unique and quite interesting. The best thing without a doubt was Koiwai farm, which is right near. I am not sure I ever saw it mentioned in my research before the trip but it was great. Awesome views, ice cream, and pizza!
   * [Koiwai Farm](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e5052.html)

**Sendai** - Almont Hotel - 5 Nights

* We picked Sendai as a break from the non-stop traveling before and as a gateway to Tashirojima. The moving around so much above wasn't as taxing as we were expecting but it was still very nice to have 5 days in one spot again. Sendai itself was nice and the first ""big-city"" feel since Sapporo. Actually it felt much busier than Sapporo. Great food choices and lots to do in the area. Matsushima Bay was fantastic as well, it was great being so close so we could go multiple times. Some of things we did are listed below.
   * [Zuihoden Mausoleum](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e5153.html)
   * [Aoba Castle](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e5152.html)

**Tashirojima** - Manga Ai-land - 1 Night

* Tashirojima was one of the places I found early in my research and just had to go. I saw some mixed opinions with some people saying the cats were in rough shape and not to go if you like cats. I decided to give it a shot after seeing a lot of people rebut these claims. I am happy to say it was absolutely fantastic and one of my favorite places I visited in Japan. The cats around the two restaurants were well cared for and seemed to be quite happy. At the end of the day they are obviously fully outdoors with relatively little care, but the residents do their best to keep them all healthy and happy. The island itself was an experience. It is almost entirely abandoned with only a handful of residents remaining. All of the structures are still there, it is eerie to say the least. 
* Manga Ai-land itself was nice. The cabins are cute and cheap, the staff was helpful, the amenities were the bare minimum but they were there. 

**Yamagata** - Daiwa Roynet - 1 Night

* There is not a whole lot in Yamagata outside of Yamadera which is why we were there. We enjoyed Yamadera but the stairs are rough if you're not in good shape. I won't lie, I almost gave up a couple of times. I made it all the way up though, and the view was worth it.

**Fukushima** - Sankyo Hotel - 1 Night

* We really just stopped in Fukushima because we needed to use a day before our AirBNB. We didn't plan on doing a whole lot and we didn't do a whole lot. 

**Aizuwakamatsu** - AirBNB - 3 Nights

* There is a lot to do here if you enjoy the sights and history. We stayed in a little AirBNB where we had a delicious homemade breakfast everyday which made the experience even better. They have a great bus system where you get a pass and it will bring you to every attraction with endless reruns. Some of the many things we checked out are listed below.
   * [Tsuruga Castle](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e7703.html)
   * [Aizu Bukeyashiki](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e7707.html)
   * [Enzoji Temple](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e7712.html)

**Hitachi** - The Square - 1 Night

* Hitachi is the sister city of our hometown which is why we decided to visit. It is actually a very nice little city though with a couple of unique parks including the [Hitachi Seaside Park](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e6203.html).

**Tsuchiura** - Celecton - 1 Night

* Another thing I had learned about many, many months before the trip was the Tsuchiura Firework Festival. Somehow it lined up and we were able to fit it in. The festival was absolutely spectacular. However, to say it was busy would be the understatement of the century. I have never seen so many people in one place. We were lucky enough to have a hotel within walking distance, even if they did raise the rates 3x for the festival. I am confident we would have waited 4-6 hours to get back to Tokyo if not.

**Tokyo** - Henn Na - 2 Nights

* We didn't do very much for these first two days in Tokyo. Our 3rd member was supposed to fly in the first morning but was delayed until the next evening. Mostly we walked around and relaxed.

**Nikko** - Turtle Inn - 1 Night

* Nikko was high on our list based on what we read of other peoples' experiences. In reality, it was a bit disappointing solely due to the crowds. There were lines for every temple, just tons of people. More people than we saw anywhere except possibly some parts of Kyoto. The temples themselves were spectacular however.

**Tokyo -** Sakura Cross Asakusa - 5 Nights

* Admittedly, we didn't do a ton in Tokyo for these 5 days either. We walked around a ton, visited Senso-Ji since it was so close to our hotel, got a bunch of souvenirs from all around, saw Godzilla Minus One. Honestly, none of us really enjoyed Tokyo as much as other cities. It's fun to walk around and people watch, there's more food choices than you could ever eat, shopping is amazing, but for us I think it was a bit more than needed. I'd definitely go back, but 3-6 days is plenty.

**Kyoto** - AirBNB - 29 Nights

* This was a long term stay to then make day trips or longer from. It was in Joyo-Shi which is pretty close to center between Nara and Kyoto. With the Kintetsu Pass we could easily get to Kyoto, Nara, Osaka, Mie, and many other places. It was an fun experience to stay in small neighborhood and walk down to the local grocery store and cook dinners at ""home"". Or take a train 2 stops down and get something different. Or get food delivery. We luckily had a Sushiro and multiple good ramen places just a short walk away. I am not sure if I'll have an opportunity to stay in Japan for this long again but if I do I am definitely going to do another long term stay somewhere.
* Kyoto was very good, but *very* busy unless you walked around lesser known areas or in off-times. We spent probably around 2 weeks in Kyoto total. We definitely prefered the little lesser visited areas. There are so many temples and other attractions that aren't one of the 5-10 famous ones.
* Nara was amazing and a definite highlight. Both the main park with the deer and the old Nara trail ([Yamanobe-no-michi Trail](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e4189.html)). The temples were some of the best we saw in Japan and the crowds were nowhere like Kyoto or Nikko. It was busy enough in some areas but there was so much to see it didn't matter. I don't see the trail mentioned very much, if you are down for some serious walking I *highly* recommend it. There are tons of fruit/vegetable stands, some restaurants, and just beatiful views. We were stopped a few times by very kind locals to talk, it was just a great experience overall.
* We really enjoyed Osaka. We didn't go many times but it was definitely unique compared to pretty much everywhere we went in Japan. Parts of it are ""grungier"" than most of Japan(that we visited) but I definitely wouldn't skip it due to that. I can also highly recommend Tower knives if you're looking for a kitchen knife!
* Mie was kind of a spur of the moment decision because we had the Kintetsu pass but we really enjoyed it!

**Yokohama** - Royal Park Hotel - 3 Nights

* This was actually a last minute addition after we had already booked the AirBNB for 31 days. I am very glad we decided to do it though. I much prefered Yokohama to Tokyo. It still has that huge city feel but it's less intimidating I guess? There's a lot to do, tons of food, and plenty of shopping. We went to Chinatown, Cup Noodle Museum, saw the Gundam(moving!) before it was removed. It also helped that the hotel was nice, mentioned further below.

**Tokyo** - Akihabara Tourist Hotel - 1 Nights

* This was just our final day in Japan to do some shopping in Akihabara before heading out. It was good, the hotel wasn't great but good locationa and it worked out fine.

Overall I was very happy with where we picked to go. I really didn't regret anything, there were a couple places I would have stayed longer or less time but nothing egregious. 

# Accommodations:

Accommodations are listed above to save space but I will comment on some specific ones here. Every accommodation was at least good, thankfully, so if I don't mention it that doesn't mean it was bad.

**Favorites**:

* **Frog Bee AirBNB Morioka**. I know most people err on the side of not recommending AirBNBs for a multitude of reasons. I for one can say all 3 we had were spectacular and were some of the best stays we had in Japan. This small AirBNB in Morioka was absolutely amazing. The Host picked us up at the local station and drove us to her apple orchard where the small guesthouse is located. She had fresh made ciders and apple sauces available for purchase and fresh apples from her orchard as welcome gifts. She also made us delicious rice balls for breakfast.
* **Royal Park Yokohama**. This was the only ""5 star"" accommodation we booked.  It isn't priced like one because it is older, but don't let that stop you from going. We had one of the higher floor rooms facing Mt. Fuji. There are a few things that show the age of the rooms but I am still surprised the price isn't 2x what it is, even for Japan. The view is just truly breathtaking, the location is amazing, the amenities are great. Endless shopping and food options just a few steps away.
* **Villa Koshido Odori.** I'm sure part of this is due to how much I loved Sapporo. This hotel is in an almost perfect location, right at the end of Odori Park. It's a new hotel and it was very nice. Maybe a bit gimmicky but our room had two gaming computers with many games, some stuff in English. There were also a bunch of racing sim setups in the hallways. It was definitely an interesting hotel and the price was(and still is) ridiculously good.
* **Cozy House AirBNB Joyo Kyoto.** This was our only long term stay and it was great. It was a small house in Joyo-Shi, just a short walk from the local Kintetsu station. We went in wanting a nice quiet place to stay for cheap and take day trips from and that's exactly what we got. We were a bit worried that it was going to be too far out of the way but I really think it's in a great spot. Out of the hustle and bustle but only a short train ride to pretty much anything you could want.

# Advice:

* Don't worry about cash too much, but worry enough. I know this is in pretty much every trip report but I thought I'd mention it regardless. I see a lot of things on both extremes, Japan is practically cash-only or Japan is almost like the US(I'm sure many other places as well) where no cash is more likely than no card. I found that outside of the major cities, cash is still a big thing. Since almost half of our trip was either in the north or more rural places, we ran into *a lot* of places that only took cash. Twice we were down to our last yen across all of us to pay a bill. With that said, don't worry about getting yen before you get there. Just get a Charles Schwab checking account and go to a 7/11 after you land and get settled.
* Use the Apple Wallet IC card if you have an iPhone. It just works. I was the only person in the group who used an iPhone. In fact, IC on iPhone was one of the leading reasons I swapped for this phone. It is just so easy to load the card, I used my Amex credit card to reload. You can't lose it, you can't easily forget it, you don't have to wait 40 minutes in line for a card.
* Look into train passes depending on location. The Kintetsu pass saved us literal 10s of thousands of yen for the month we were in Joyo. It also let us go to places we would not have gone like Mie. But do the math, many passes aren't worth it or just break even if you don't use them extensively.
* I am not sure if this needs to be said but don't stick to only Japanese restaurants. I found the best Indian and Chinese restaurants I've ever been to in Japan.
* Be mindful of your amount of luggage. It's very easy to get overloaded early. This is a bigger issue if you're there for an extended period of time, but I think it's important for everyone. So much stuff to buy, so little space to store it.
* Don't take a lot of luggage with you *to* Japan. This fits with the last one but I think it's important enough to make another point. I highly recommend only taking a carry-on. We all took carry-ons only, then purchased two large suitcases once in Japan. We only had our backpacks for the whole first month. It limited what we could buy, but it was so nice to only have a backpack. I agree with most people that the luggage forwarding is very good, but if you don't have to use it at all it's even better. Also use the hotel early luggage storage. Every hotel we went to offered it.



# Closing Thoughts

Overall the trip was really something special. I don't see being able take off 2.5 months again anytime soon so I'll count myself lucky. I am hoping to go back for a couple of weeks next fall. I gathered most of my info from reading over posts on here so I appreciate everyone who's posted anything!

I think a couple of my days might be off and I definitely forgot like half of what I wanted to say, but it's something. I'd be more than happy to answer any questions! Food, accomodations, tips, anything! 

Also just as a rough estimate, I spent right around $6000 ish for the full trip for myself. Very happy with the cost, it definitely helped to share hotels.

1f89t2l,"Trip Report - 23 Days of Honeymoon - Ancestor visits, Mt. Fuji, and Baseball","This will be a bit long at the beginning as it has some extra details - feel free to skip the first few days if you care more about the logistics/non-heritage stuff we did.  We did get the 21 day JR pass (math said we'd get a little extra value so we wanted to see how well it did with the new pricing) and it ended up being worth it, but it requires a LOT of travel, so I'd still probably not recommend it unless you're moving around a lot on Shinkansen.

My wife and I are both Yonsei - 4th Generation Japanese Americans - and have always wanted to dig further into our heritage in Japan, so the main focus of the Honeymoon to Japan was to visit the village locations that each of our great grandparents were born in, and if possible, find a grave or something.  Unfortunately, we didn't get all of our Koseki in time for that, but we did get a big surprise with my paternal line (detailed below).  

  
Note - Because we're 4th gen (from California) we don't have much Japanese speaking or as much information about our family history due to WW2, so most of our digging came through old documents and asking any surviving Nisei what we could!

  
**Day 1 - July 31st/August 1st - Arrival and Home Base Hotel**

Depart SFO to HND on JAL 1.  

  
Arrive at HND in the early afternoon, picked up a 21 day JR pass and headed to our hotel in Sumida.  

  
Checked in to the hotel in Sumida- this would be our ""Home"" in Tokyo and where we would store our big luggage when it was not in use.  The check out date was August 23rd.

  
Got Dinner at our favorite Udon shop in Tokyo (Taniya) and then passed out at the hotel.

  
**Day 2 - August 2nd - Treats, Temples, Tokyo Dome**

Explored a confectionary shop in Setagaya my wife had found online, visited a few parks and shrines/temples in the area and then headed to Tokyo Dome City.

  
At Tokyo Dome, we visited the Baseball hall of fame, got dinner, and then watched the Giants vs Swallows.  
After game finished, went back to Sumida, picked up some snacks at 7/11 and packed our carry on bags for the trip to Kochi Prefecture.

  
**Day 3 - August 3rd - Arrive in Kochi and Meet Locals/Hidaka Village**

*Kochi is where my paternal line is from, and thus my family name and family crest (which we did not know).  When doing my ancestry research, I found that the original village was no longer around, as it merged with 2 others some time in the 1950s due to shrinking population.  Luckily for me - the newly merged village had a small Tourism Board, and when I reached out using bad google translate, the person running it happened to know English, and said they would be more than happy to help me find out where my family lived, and if they could, find the gravestone of my ancestors!*

We woke up early Tokyo so we could make sure we were packed and ready for an early afternoon flight from Haneda to Kochi Ryoma airport.  Flew into Kochi, picked up a rental car and checked in to a hotel in Kochi City to use as home base while we were in Kochi (I could not find any hotels in the family village, but was told later they have some, but they don't have an online presence, so next time I'll just use my contacts there!).   

When we arrived, I messaged the tourism board on Line to let them know we were in town and excited to meet them the next day for some exploring around the area.  They invited me to a small ""Izakaya"" sort of gathering in the village that night, so my wife and I drove down, ate at a local restaurant using the tiny bits of Japanese we know, and met up with my contact at the tourism board.

It was a VERY small location that looks like it is rented out on occasion for small get togethers like this one, but I got to meet the person I had been communicating with, his friends, and his friends' kids.  We chatted a bit (with the contact doing his best to help translate, but also with some of the locals using small bits of english and us using small bits of Japanese), ate, drank, and set off some fireworks and played with some bubbles.  One of the people also gifted us a pair of Naruko hand clappers with our names in Katakana, the wedding date, and art/kanji to wish us a happy marriage.  Incredibly fun and kind folks, and one of my favorite nights of the entire trip.  

After hanging out with them for a few hours, we headed back to Kochi City with plans to meet back up for a caving expedition - The first full day in Kochi was to explore the area and learn about it.



**Day 4 - August 4th - Learning about Hidaka and watching minor league baseball**

We woke up early and met up at the Tourism Board office at 8am to explore a local cave (Saruda Cave), a flood abatement pond area with a LOT of Dragonflies (got to see the rare Oni Dragonfly alongside a bunch of others), and then took a tour on the Niyodo river for lunch.  All of these were incredibly fun, and it was pretty cool to imagine that my Great Grandparents may have explored the cave for fun as a kid, or swam in the river to cool off on the warm summer days.

After our lunch on the river (they have a boat that explains some local history and a shop that sells bento to eat on the boat), we headed back into Kochi City for baseball.  We got back to the hotel to change out of our caving clothes and into some lighter clothes AND our Fighting Dogs Jerseys to support the local team!  Got to enjoy a Kochi win and then headed to the local Round 1 to play some DDR and a few other arcade games.  Went to sleep early so we could be ready for a full day of family history on the 5th.

  
**Day 5 - August 5th - Learning about my family and Hidaka**

Woke up early again to meet up at the Tourism Board office at 8am.  From there we caravaned in our cars to the Okina area of Hidaka where my ancestors apparently originally lived.  They had a small meeting center there where I got to visit people currently living IN the Okina area, and they showed me the land records dating back to the 1920s or so.  Unfortunately my family had apparently moved out of Okina before the 1920s, so while the Koseki had their address, the land records indicated that a separate family had bought and worked on the land afterwards.  They still were able to track down the actual locations of the homes, however, so we hiked up the hills to see the 1st original dwelling that was on record, and I took a photo next to the well that would have been used by my family for water.  The 2nd dwelling had been destroyed in a mudslide sometime in the past, so the building had been rebuilt, but we still hiked up there too and visited the area.

Around this time, the group showed me some photos of them going through the forest just outside town and up into the mountains searching for my family's old gravestones, and they told me that the gravestones USED to be right outside the 1st and 2nd dwellings, but had been moved around 10 years ago by the descendants of my great grandfather's brother, and they were excited to meet me and show me the current location of the graves later that afternoon/evening!  Until then, however, we had a few more things to do in Hidaka.

Next up was the local Temple.  The priest? (Not sure the title used) had helped with determining the correct temple/shrines my family would have utilized, so I was shown how to pray/pay respects to the souls of my family that had come before.  He also provided me with 5 sticks of incense for us to burn at the actual gravesite (that was located in Kochi City).

After all of the heavier emotional stuff, we had a little break for Omu Raisu (the local specialty in Hidaka) and after learning that my hometown in California had a lot of Tomato farming too, they showed me to their main greenhouses and tomato/produce factory.  It was pretty fun to see, as I've spent a LOT of time on my cousins' tomato farms back in the states when I was younger, and it was fun to see the differences (mainly their greenhouse use for their specialized Tomato stuff vs my US family just having giant tracts of land uncovered for the tomatoes.  Also - different varieties of tomatoes too due to the specific needs of one vs the other.)

When we finished with all the produce related activities, including a stop to buy produce as tribute for the ancestors, we caravaned again to Kochi City (the exact location I saved on my phone, but I can't remember the area off the top of my head, and it's not too important for the internet to know) where we met up with an older gentleman and his two sons.  They ran over to our car, gave us ice cream and ice cold bottles of tea and said ""follow us"" and jumped into their cars to show us the gravesite (which was maybe 1 km away from their house I think).  I was able to ""meet"" my ancestors.  There were a good chunk of graves, and I was shown the different stones for each relative, as well as the Family Crest.  We paid our respects/prayed, and talked a bit at the gravesite, eventually moving to a local cafe to continue the conversation for a few more hours.  Exchanged contact information and helped update each other's family trees!  Once we were all done, and lots of bowing and gift exchanging later, my wife and I finally got back to our Kochi hotel and rested.  That was the end of our Kochi stuff for the most part, and we would be leaving to Osaka (area) the next day.

  
**Day 6 - August 6th - Udon and heading to Koshien**

Our favorite food is Udon, and we had a mission to eat Udon on every island of Japan this trip for fun.  We already had some at the first restaurant in Kochi, but we don't know how often we'll be able to visit Japan, so we wanted to go back to the Udon School in Takamatsu that we had visited before.  

We drove from Kochi City to Takamatsu and attended the Udon making class again.  Afterwards, we drove to Kinashi station, where on our 1st trip to take the Udon class we erroneously though we'd be able to get a taxi, resulting in a 6KM hike into Takamatsu.  Took a photo because I thought it was funny, and then drove all the way back to Kochi City in time to return the car, get a snack in Kochi Airport, and fly out to Itami airport.

Once arriving at Itami, we headed to Koshien Stadium for our hotel (a few blocks away).



**Day  7 - August 7th - Summer Tournament**

Woke up early, headed to Koshien Stadium to watch Opening Ceremony and the 1st game.

After 1st game, they had everyone leave, so we grabbed lunch at the KFC across the way and went back for the next 3 games afterwards.

After the last game, we took the train to Shin-Osaka Station to stay in a hotel there for our next day's travels.

  
**Day 8 - August 8th - Train to Hokkaido**

Woke up early, caught the Shinkansen to Tokyo, took the train to Sumida, swapped out clothes/did laundry.

In the early afternoon, we boarded the Shinkansen from Tokyo to Shin-Hakodate station in Hokkaido where we would connect to the local train into Sapporo that evening.  Grabbed eki ben for both of us on the trip!

Once arriving in Shin-Hakodate, transferred to the train to Sapporo (had to check with the gate attendant, as Navitime and Google were telling me a different platform number than it looked like the correct train would be, and was able to get the right train) and checked in around 10:30 (ate a fami chiki for energy by the end of the night).

  
**Day 9 - August 9th - Noodles and Chocolate**

Needing to get Udon on Hokkaido, we found a shop only a train station away.

  
Headed to Shiroi Koibito's factory for an afternoon of fun.  They have a little history of chocolate walkthrough ""museum"" thing you get to learn at, as well as a view of the factory floor as chocolates/treats are being made.  We also got high tea styled tea and treats in the shop upstairs and did a chocolate cookie treat thing workshop (you have to pay, not included with the entry).  There's also a little animatronic show I think every hour in the garden, as well as a whole play area across the street.  If you're in the area, it's definitely fun!  

After Chocolate, we had a reservation at a Ramen shop, as we figured we had to try Miso Ramen if we were in Hokkaido!  Grabbed dinner, explored one of the underground malls at the train station, and headed back to the hotel.

  
**Day 10 - August 10th - Nippon Ham Fighters and Pokemon Store**

As part of my love of baseball, I figured we'd have to watch the Fighters play in Es Con Field, so we hopped on the train again and took in the game.  (The only PL game we saw, the rest of the NPB games were CL)

After the game, we went back to Sapporo to get dinner and realized there was a Pokemon Store in one of the malls, so I went in searching for something, anything Scyther related (my favorite Pokemon).  After being disappointed that they have plushies and toys for like 75% or more it seemed of the original 151, but NOT my Scyther, I found a series of stickers with all 151 original (yay).  So if you really like one of the original 151, and it's NOT one of the popular ones, check out a store - the stickers should have all 151.  Mostly in order, except the popular ones are at the top (like Pikachu is probably top left instead of Bulbasaur, but Scyther was near the bottom, as he's number 123)

Got Tonkatsu after Pokemon, and went back to the hotel for a VERY early morning train to the airport.



**Day 11 - August 11th - Back to Honshu, beginning of the rest of the ancestors**

We booked the 1st flight to Haneda out of Sapporo/Chitose Airport, so we had to get up pretty early, but a mini nap on the plane helped us get back to our Sumida hotel.  

Dropped off all our baseball merch/Pokemon stuff, grabbed our laundry detergent, got lunch at a local burger place nearby (McLean Burger) which was pretty darn tasty, and hopped on another Shinkansen to Hiroshima, where something like 90% of Japanese Americans (older families, not more recent immigrants) came from, and the rest of our ancestors except one came from.

Checked into our hotel near Zoom Zoom Stadium and grabbed some Gyoza at an Izakaya, returned to the hotel, and went to sleep.

  
**Day 12 - August 12th - Wife's side Heritage (and a little of mine) and the beauty of Hiroshima Prefecture**

Woke up early (again) so we could grab the rental car from Hiroshima Station.

*Note - I am 1/2 Japanese (both parents are 1/2 also, so that's fun), but my wife is 100%.  7 of her 8 great grandparents were from Hiroshima Prefecture.  2 of my 4 were - the other 2 were in Kochi.  Also, my wife's maternal grandfather actually spent time in Japan after being born in the US, and lived in Hiroshima for a while where his friend painted a waterfall from a local hike.  Our big goal for this day was to find that waterfall and let my wife see this place that was so important to her grandfather.*

I did a bunch of research ahead of time for all our ancestors, and was able to - at the very least - get the name of the village they were born in/came from, so equipped with a list of the villages and marks on my google maps for my best estimate at the location of something to indicate the village's existence, we headed out on a trip around Hiroshima Prefecture!

Our first stop was Shinanotaki Waterfalls, which we had tracked down to be the waterfall in my wife's grandfather's painting.  The drive through the countryside was beautiful (Shikoku was too, so if you get a chance to drive, go for it!) and we arrived at the trailhead while it was still early.  We went a few KM in to visit all 3 of the waterfalls and are pretty sure we were able to find the correct fall of the 3 matching against a photo of the painting.  She was able to pay her respects to her grandfather there as well, and we spent a lot of time just enjoying the quiet nature.  (Be careful if you're out there though, there are snakes once you get further in to the area where it's less traveled)

Next, we hit a series of villages/areas our family was from.  In some, they had museums detailing the history of the area (some museums were a little bigger, with english translations, others were very small and had Japanese only), in others, the only proof of existence was a bus stop or train stop with the old town's name.  After some digging around, we found that those with just a train or bus stop more or less just ran out of people/dissolved, and the stops were named, as they are in the location the villages used to be.  So - we still got to visit the locations!  

*Next trip we are determined to find more, so if we are able to focus and learn Japanese better, we will try to speak with local temples and others in the area to try and narrow down where gravestones may be.*

Thankfully, most of our ancestors lived in locations that were able to be one big loop around the prefecture, and we got to our last stop - my maternal side - an hour or so before sunset.  I got a photo next to a government building that marked the village's location (it was now a suburb of Hiroshima City), and have noted it for a future trip when I can hopefully get a chance to find the grave.

After the long day of exploring, we got Pizza at the Pizza Vending Machine (which was just a fun thing we saw online and wanted to try), and got ready for an expected emotional day to come.

  
**Day 13 - August 13th - Peace Museum, Costco, Sore Yuke Carp**

Being Japanese American, we were very interested in visiting the Peace Museum in Hiroshima, so I booked an early slot (8am) due to the date being close to the anniversary AND it being Obon season.  This was the right decision as it was packed inside.

If people can only do one thing in the city of Hiroshima, I think the Peace Museum should be one of the candidates.  It is so full of emotion, education, and just incredible stories of survivors and the whole lead up to the Atomic Bombing(s).  There isn't much I can write here to convey how powerful everything was visiting, but in a sense it reminded me of the Holocaust museum in its call for action and the devastation caused by the bomb.   If you can go, I suggest going.  They sometimes have survivors speak, as well as folks who are continuing on the stories of those who survived.  I recommend listening to their talks as well.  Don't forget to explore the whole Peace Park too, they have more free exhibits and just walking through the place that used to be a bustling district feels eerie.  

After the museum, I knew we would need some time to digest everything we saw, so after realizing there was a Costco in Hiroshima, I asked my wife if she wanted to go just for the novelty of it.  

Costco is as you would expect.  It's a Costco.  Feels pretty similar to a US one, but with some differences in products (although it's like in the US, where there are differences based on region).  The food court was great.  We got the (pork) hot dog, bulgogi bake, a smoothie, ice cream sundae, and the bucket of chicken fingers/potato wedge things.  Ate - got some cheap water, bought some non-perishable Japanse groceries we'd usually get in the US, but in a bigger size because Costco, and then headed back to the hotel to prepare for the baseball game.

*For those who don't know - the Hiroshima Toyo Carp are a BIG part of the city, and are very strongly connected with the city, it's struggles, reconstruction, and perseverance.  .*

Mazda Zoom Zoom Stadium is where my wife fell in love with the Hiroshima Carp, and maybe fully committed to her enthusiasm of Nippon Professional Baseball.  All the NPB games we had been to so far were wonderful experiences, but the joy and love of the sport and their team was just something special in Hiroshima.  Even though they lost that game, my wife immediately asked me to try and find more NPB games to watch on our trip, so I bought tickets to a Swallows vs Carp game and Giants vs Carp game later on the trip.

If you can only watch 1 baseball team in Japan, I'd say the Carp are up there.  Can't get their song out of my head either, or some of the player songs!  

  
**Day 14 - August 14th - Miyajima and Hofu for the final ancestor**

This was our last full day with a car in Japan, and while I had originally planned on taking the train to my wife's final ancestor village in the city of Hofu, it wasn't too much of a drive, and the specific location wasn't really that close to a subway.  Plus - driving would let us stop at anywhere fun we found along the way, such as Miyajima island (which DOES have a JR station if you want to visit it from Hiroshima but don't have a car).

We got to Miyajima early, which was nice, as we were able to visit the shrine with it being a little less crowded.  There are 2 ferries to get there, one of which is operated by JR, so the JR pass WILL work on it (you still have to pay 100 yen I believe total on the way TO the island, but the way back is free) and saves you like 400 yen, so a good Dandy Ice Cream bar and a drink.

There was a local museum about the area near the shrine that we visited, as well as just walking through the streets.  I think you could spend the better part of the day here if you wanted, there's an aquarium as well as a whole other park and area to visit up the mountain (you can take a tram or walk I believe).  Unfortunately, we wanted to make sure we got to have fun in Hofu (Yamaguchi Prefecture), so we left after a lunchtime snack of yakitori.

The drive, once again, was very pretty on the way alongish the coastline and towards Yamaguchi prefecture.  Getting into Hofu, our first stop was the village my wife's final ancestor had come from, and they had a community center we were able to take a photo in front of!  Unfortunately they were closed at that time, but next trip, we'll try to go in and learn a little more!  The village is just a suburb of Hofu now, and part of it is even just a big ol' Aeon mall, but it was really special to her, and a little funny when we realized the family that came from there didn't have as cool of a name as we thought they did.  The name was just the Village name with da after it, which we are assuming would be Áî∞.  Either way, it was really cool to be able to hit all the villages!

After the community center, we saw that we were not too far from Hofu Tenmangu Shrine, so we drove there and visited.  It's quite peaceful, and was very relaxing (and refreshing) to just view the city from the top of the never completed pagoda. 

After paying respects to the kami/shrine, we left Hofu to get back to Hiroshima, do laundry, and sleep!

  
**Day 15 - August 15th - Head to Yamaguchi on** **~~Hello Kitty Shinkansen~~** **by way of Hakata (you read that right)**

Our original plan for this day was going to be taking the Hello Kitty Shinkansen from Hiroshima to Yamaguchi, drop off our luggage, and then take the train to Hofu to find the village my wife's last ancestors were from.  We already visited the village though, so we figured we'd just take the Hello Kitty Shinkansen to Hakata to maximize Hello Kitty time and to maybe sneak an Udon in Kyushu so we could get every island down, and THEN back to Yamaguchi (well, the big 4) 

We started the day by heading to a batting cage/arcade in Hiroshima, as we had the car until around 2pm (The Hello Kitty train was due to arrive at 2:08pm, so we were going to return it at 1ish and get to the platform).  Batting cages are always fun for me, and this one had 2 pitching cages as well as the usual Japanese styled batting cages (they have players pitching to you and the release point is where the hand would be, so you can get timing down.  They also have different pitches the machine can throw at you).  After feeling accomplished as a former High School pitcher in making contact with some pitches thrown at around 140 kmph and getting a few good strikes thrown at a whopping 100+ units per hour (I'll pretend it was MPH), we played some Initial D, rhythm games, and headed to Hiroshima station to return the car and ride on the Hello Kitty train!

After the car return and lunch, we got to the platform in time to see the 2:08 train arrive.  Us, alongside a bunch of other folks who did NOT check the JR train status pages that morning were excited as we recorded/watched a normal ol' Kodama show up.  (Hello Kitty had maintenance issues that morning and had to be cancelled/replaced with a normal train)

I was more bummed than I should have been, but my wife was very supportive and convinced me to rebook a train for the following day to ride the Hello Kitty train if possible - more on that on the 16th.  

We arrived in Hakata, stored our luggage using ECBO Cloak (which was pretty convenient) and got ourselves some Udon.  After eating dinner, we explored a bit and visited some shrines/temples.  Fun overall day, and we will have to visit Kyushu again!  

Jumped back on the Shinkansen back to Yamaguchi to sleep and prepare for our Onsen day in Yamaguchi.

  
**Day 16 - August 16th - Hello Kitty can't escape us, Onsen time**

While on the Train to Hakata the day before, and because we had the JR pass so it was no additional cost to us, I booked a trip ON the Hello Kitty Shinkansen from Yamaguchi to Okayama and then back.  It was silly, but it would also give us somewhere to store our luggage (on the train with us) between our Yamaguchi Hotel and our Onsen we were staying at in the Yuda Onsen area of Yamaguchi.

Hello Kitty was fun, it's just a normal train with 2 special cars at the front and Hello Kitty stickers/decorations on the doors between the other cars (and in a few other places), but it was still something different, and we got a photo with the cat herself!  Unfortunately not much Kerropi stuff for my wife (her favorite Sanrio character), but we still had a good time.

Check in for the Hotel/Onsen/Ryokan was at 3pm, so even after our shinkansen fun time, we had time to burn, so we dropped our luggage off at the Ryokan and explored the area.  Found a nice little park ""Inoue Park"" and enjoyed some time there before fully being lazy and enjoying the hot springs and our hotel/room (we got one of the fancier rooms that also had a private hot spring bath for us).

Ate yakuniku for dinner down the street, and returned to the hotel to be lazy again.  

  
**Day 17 - August 17th - Getting to Nagoya, being thankful to the ancestors and luck**

*Note - If you were in Japan during August or watched the news/weather, you may have seen that there was an Earthquake near the beginning of the month as well as a series of storms/typhoons.  We were SUPER lucky the whole trip.  The earthquake hit southern Japan when we were in Hokkaido, the first typhoon (that I remember at least) was avoided by us as we went from Hokkaido to Tokyo, and the storms flooding Tokyo hit while we were in Yamaguchi/Nagoya.  We even avoided a massive rainstorm later on the trip by seconds and got out of Tokyo back home to the US right before the next typhoon hit.  Not sure if we're lucky or what, but I'll give thanks to my ancestors as well for keeping us safe :)*

My wife had a friend she had tutored in school years ago (helping her with English when she was in the US for a few years) that lived in Nagoya, so we visited her for a day and brought her some requested items - Ranch Dressing, Takis, and Chili candies.  We also hung out and did Karaoke, that was the 17th and 18th, so there wasn't much else in Nagoya THIS time around, but we'll be back for sure.

  
**Day 18 - August 18th - Leaving Nagoya and more Baseball**

After leaving Nagoya we went back to our Sumida hotel and swapped out our luggage/clothes again/did more laundry.  We had lunch on the train, so we just made our way to Meiji Jingu Stadium to watch the Carp take on the Swallows.  We sat in the Carp cheering section for this game so my wife could join in on the cheers while I kept score. 

Not much else besides how much I love (NPB CL) baseball :)

  
**Day 19 - August 19th - Day off and Kimono Shopping**

Now that we were back in Tokyo at our main hotel, we wanted to grab some Kimono.  With my family crest now known, I also was hoping I'd be able to find something with it, but realistically just wanted to get us some new Kimono now that we had lost so much weight and also just as something to wear in warmer months (our Kimono we have are for colder weather).

My wife was able to get a really nice kimono and yukata (with the shorter sleeves now that she's married :P ) and I was able to find a lighter one for myself as well.  While looking at Kimono we also saw a Haori with my family's crest, so I grabbed that as well!

We got back to our hotel , ate dinner and got to sleep early because the next 2 days were going to be on Mt. Fuji!

  
**Day 20 - August 20th - Mt. Fuji and the Subashiri trail**

Because I totally botched things and wrote the wrong day down to reserve mountain huts, I ended up booking a guided hike (in english) up Mt. Fuji with the Fuji Mountain Guides, as it came with a hut, but also was nice to have guides help us out/get timing figured out to watch the sunrise at the top, and a bunch of other small things along the way that were useful.

We met up with the guides in Tokyo, took a private small bus to the Subashiri 5th station, and began the hike.  

It's pretty steep, but doable if you are in okay shape.  Just take your time and be careful.  We did opt into buying a non-walking stick to get branded/stamped at stations we stopped at along the way.

Hike took a while, but we had beautifully clear weather on the way up and we were able to get some Udon along the way too, so we got 4 island and Mt. Fuji for our Udon pilgrimage.  As we neared the 8th station (the hotel we were staying at - Fujisan Hotel) the weather started to get a lot colder and much more overcast.  I stepped into the hotel dry, and as my wife was stepping in, the heavens opened up and it started to POUR.  Her backpack (with a cover) got hit with water, but she was 1 second or so quick enough getting in that she didn't get hit.  (yay for good luck!).  Ate dinner at the hotel, and then an early sleep as the plan was to visit the summit just before the sun rose.

  
**Day 21 - August 21st - Sunrise on Fuji and dying on the way down**

I didn't get to sleep immediately because I was too excited about everything and was playing on my phone.  That was a poor decision, just as trying to drink less water so I'd have to pee less (toilets cost per use on Mt. Fuji) so I woke up with a pretty bad headache from lack of sleep, dehydration, and probably a little bit of altitude sickness. 

I powered through, and with the assistance and encouragement of my wife (she's pretty awesome btw), we made it to the top before the sunrise came.  Once I was up there, had a bunch of water in me, and I think just the beauty of it all, I was feeling a lot better headache/nausea wise and we were able to enjoy some time visiting the shrine, getting the summit stamps, and enjoying the view.  (She brought her film camera on the trip, so she was having a blast taking photos as well).  

The way down the Subashiri trail (not sure if the others are like this too) was rough.  It's ""fast"", but it's pretty steep and a LOT of really loose sand.  If you go slow, you won't fall much, if at all, but it's really tough on the knees!  By the time we got to the bottom it felt weird walking on levelish ground, and our legs were super sore.  Thankfully we were able to hop on the bus and get dropped off in Gotemba where we took a series of trains to get to Hakone and the hotel my wife's dad's cousin gifted us a stay in as a wedding gift (Hyatt Regency Hakone).

With dead legs, we cleaned ourselves, rested, ate dinner at the sushi restaurant in the hotel, and I just lay on the couch while my wife soaked in the hot spring downstairs.  We ended up splurging and getting room service, and the cajun fries were surprisingly delicious!   

  
**Day 22 - August 22nd - The final FULL day of Japan, and more Baseball!**

Still sore from Mt. Fuji, and with our JR pass having just expired, we took the hotel shuttle to Odawara and booked the Romancecar from there to Shinjuku.  From there we were able to take local trains back to our hotel in Sumida and start reorganizing and packing everything up.  We also did a full load of all our laundry so we'd have less to do when we returned home.

For our final big event, we watched the Hiroshima Toyo Carp take on the Yomiuri Giants.  For baseball fans, it was pretty exciting, a 1 run game going into the top of the 9th where the Carp tied it against the starter for the Giants who had been throwing a wonderful game.  We sat in the Giants' cheering section this game, so my wife had to hide her Carp love and wear a Giants hat this time around (as Northern California folks, our families rooted for the SF Giants, so we have by default been rooting for the Tokyo Giants too, in addition to the Carp).

After the carp pulled out the win in Extra Innings, we stayed until the stadium was closing to wait out the subway rush, but also to just enjoy the last few moments of baseball.  

Finally, we returned to Sumida for one last night and packed our last few merchandise items away.

  
**Day 23 - August 23rd - One last Udon and leaving Japan**

We had a blast this trip.  I can't wait to come again and visit the relatives again, maybe find more once we can speak better in the other cities too!  But - before we left, we wanted to get our favorite Udon spot again, so we went to Taniya once more (There's a reason we stayed in Sumida, it's close to Taniya!) and ate some Udon while watching the Koshien Summer Tournament's final game, which was also a great one to see.

When finished, we headed to the hotel to collect our luggage they were holding, and hopped on the local train to Narita airport and headed back home.

  
**Things of note -**

JR pass was worth it to us by a non-trivial amount, but a large part of that extra buffer is the re-booked Hello Kitty Shinkansen round trip.  If you aren't planning on taking as many/as long of a Shinkansen route as we did, it is probably not worth it, but please still check one of the many calculators online.  I personally like the Navitime one for estimating the cost, but it seemed to be stuck on the 7 day pass when trying to tell you your value, so just take the number you'll spend on rides from that and compare it against the JR pass webpage (the .net one is the one done BY JR I believe)

If you're going during Obon or any big festivals, try booking your trains a few days in advance at least, because it seemed pretty busy on most of ours (I booked mine almost entirely the first day of the trip once I got the pass, and I had zero issues finding us spots, but it was pretty close on some trains).  Also, please book the oversized baggage seats if you're gonna have oversized baggage.  There were a lot of people who didn't, and it caused some discomfort/annoyance on the fuller trains.

I love the heat, my wife enjoys/tolerates the heat.  It was definitely hot in August.  I know I'm weird that I enjoyed the heat and humidity.  Folks told us that this was hotter than usual, but things have been hotter than usual recently in Japan, so if you are sensitive to the heat and you CAN avoid August, I'd suggest it.  If you like the heat, or if you don't have a choice, don't be too deterred.  It's hot, but if you have an umbrella to shade vs the sun, and you plan trips into Convenience Stores when doing long walks or malls, or places with A/C, it will help.  Also, just hydrate a lot and bring sunscreen :)

Japan is super busy with tourists - but it seems to be only in the ""popular"" spots.  Our trip took us outside of the hotspots, so we didn't really see any overcrowding for almost the entire trip (outside of subways right after baseball games).  So - I'd say if things are crowded in Tokyo/Osaka/Kyoto, go visit the countryside!  There's so much beauty out there, and you may find something cool!  Even within Tokyo, a lot of the places we went weren't very full of tourists, and we were some of the only foreigners there.

We converted currency at Haneda and got a reasonably good rate.  Same with Hakata Station's bank conversion machine.  We were able to use Credit Card for most things in cities, but just ask/check ahead of time.  The smaller towns needed cash a lot more.

For internet/phone we did a combination of sim cards and a pocket wifi.  SIM card worked the whole time quite well, and so did the pocket wifi, but the pocket wifi sometimes needed to be restarted to reconnect after it had lost signal for a while (Shinkansen, or tunnel, or just on our hikes outside of cell service).  The pocket wifi  also had a pretty good battery and would last essentially a whole day (If you are heading out early and plan to stay out late, I'd bring a power bank to give it an extra 2 or so hours)

1fgsk9j,"[Trip Report] Family trip to Kyoto, Takayama, Nagoya, Kobe with day trips","Hi, I would like to share a trip report on my family‚Äôs second time to Japan. I (25M) travelled with my mum (58F), my brother (23M), in June 2024 for 17 days. As none of us drive, we relied only on public transport. I would like to share some tips as well as lessons learnt! :)

**Abbreviations used:** pp (per person), JPY (Japanese Yen), SGD (Singapore Dollar), Ltd Ex (Limited express JR train), FOC (free of charge)

**Flight:** We flew using Scoot LCC to and from KIX. \~500 SGD/54000 JPY pp

**Transport:** We got the JR West All Area Pass for the first 7 days of our trip (\~26000 JPY pp). We also got the Kansai Area pass for the last 4 days of our trip (\~7000 JPY pp). For more information on these regional passes, visit this url: https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2357.html. We also relied on public buses, chartered buses and subways but only when JR was not a viable option. Lastly, we also relied a lot on walking (and clocked at least 10km-13km on average daily pp)

**Accommodation:** We stayed in 3 star/business hotels in Nagoya and Kobe, and Airbnbs in Kyoto and Takayama. The main consideration was location, within \~1km of the main JR station (in this case Nagoya JR, Kobe JR, Kyoto JR and Takayama JR), as well as affordability. Total cost spent on accommodation for 17 days was \~ 180000 JPY, or 60000 JPY pp.

**Focus of the trip:** Nature, sightseeing and hidden gems. Some highlights include Wazuka, Takayama, Ine/Amanohashidate, Fukui, Shirakawago, Sekigahara and Shimonoseki. Ine and Wazuka are also in the official list of the most beautiful villages of Japan (https://utsukushii-mura.jp/map/).

**Total Cost:** \~2700 SGD/293000 JPY pp in total, including plane tickets, JR regional passes/tickets and accommodation

**Intention behind this report:** I hope this report will be useful, especially if you are relying on public transport. For easier readability, I‚Äôve chosen not to get too detailed. That being said, if you have any questions, please fire away :) and I will do my best to answer them! Also, I have placed asterisks at places which I recommend going (from \* to \*\*\*, with \*\*\* being the most recommended).

(Days 1-6: Stayed at Kyoto)

**Day 1: Arrival in Kyoto**

Description: Touched down at KIX and took the Haruka Ltd Ex to Kyoto JR. Explored Kyoto Skyway and had dinner at Kyoto JR before heading back to our Airbnb.

Tips: There is a staircase in Kyoto JR with light illuminations every night. There is also a place with many ramen restaurants located at the floor 10, that‚Äôs where we had our dinner. If you are a ‚ÄúHello Kitty‚Äù fan, do consider taking the Haruka Ltd Ex as it is ‚ÄúHello Kitty‚Äù themed.

**Day 2: Day trip to Hiroshima**

Travel: \~2.5 hours one way (Kyoto JR --> Shin-Osaka JR via local train, Shin-Osaka JR --> Hiroshima JR via shinkansen)

**Places visited:** Peace Memorial Museum\*\*, A bomb Dome\*, Ground zero, Okonomimura\*, Hondori Street

Description: We reached Hiroshima about 1100hrs. Took an ‚Äúold-school‚Äù electric tram to the A bomb dome. The dome was haunting in some way, albeit with some semblance of its magnificence left. Went to the museum and surrounding memorial area, which I would remember for a long time. The suffering of the civilians was truly great. We saw many school children paying their respects and singing commemorative songs. We then walked to the hypocenter, which was next to a clinic. Standing there while reflecting on what we saw in the museum was truly profound. We went to Okonomimura, for Hiroshima-styled Okonomiyaki, which I really enjoyed. We wandered around Hondori street, Don Quijote and got bento sets for dinner to eat on the shinkansen trip back to Kyoto. We left Hiroshima at around 2000hrs, and reached our accommodation at 2300hrs.

Vibe: I really loved the vibe of Hiroshima, how it is bustling despite its challenging past. I also liked how they preserved traces of its past even in the midst of rebuilding, for example, I saw some architecture preserved from WW2 in Hondori Street itself with signboards explaining what they were.

Tips: Do not skip the Peace Memorial Museum, it is a very well-thought out museum with many artifacts preserved such as the famed ‚ÄúHuman shadow etched in stone‚Äù. Do consider to prebook your tickets online, so as to skip queues entirely. It would be good to dedicate at least a full day to Hiroshima.

¬†

**Day 3: Day trip to Ine/Amanohashidate**

Travel: \~3.5 hours to Ine (Kyoto JR --> Fukuchiyama JR via Ltd Ex, Fukuchiyama JR --> Amanohashidate JR via Kyoto Tango Railway (non JR), Amanohashidate --> Ine via bus)

**Places visited**: Ine bay/funaya\*\*\*, Ine caf√©\*, Amanohashidate Kasamatsu Park\*, Amanohashidate sandbar, Kaisen Bridge.

Description: Departed for Fukuchiyama JR at 0700hrs, and reached Amanohashidate JR around 0930hrs. Then, we took a local bus from right outside Amanohashidate JR to Ine and reached Ine before 1100hrs. We had a sashimi set lunch at Kajiya Ine, which was amazingly fresh (Ine is a fishing town). We had some spare time after to walk around the town, taking many photos, enjoying the nature and also had drinks at Ine caf√©. At 1430hrs, we took the bus heading towards Amanohashidate, but dropped off halfway at Amanohashidate cable shita station, to take the ropeway up Kasamatsu Park. From there, we could enjoy views of the sandbar, but we did not spend long there as there was nothing much else to do. We took the ropeway down, rushed a quick dinner, and then started walking across the sandbar back to Amanohashidate JR (about 3.5km). The sandbar walk was fun but not especially spectacular, it has many pine trees though and nice sandy beaches. At a bridge nearing the end of our walk, we managed to spot a wild cormorant and multiple jellyfishes. We managed to see the Kaisen Bridge (rotating bridge) in action too. We left Amanohashidate JR at about 1900hrs and reached our accommodation at 2200hrs.

Vibe: Really loved the vibe of Ine. Literally a town between the mountains and the sea, on the outskirts of Kyoto. There was only a one lane street running through the town hence cars had to reverse when they met in the middle. There was no internet access and only emergency services were available, and there was only one store selling local produce. But all these added to the old-school, untouched charm. Staring at the Funaya which have been preserved for hundreds of years, while enjoying the fresh sea breeze and calls of kites and gulls, was really magical. Hence, although Ine is not very accessible, I cannot emphasize enough how worth it is to still travel there. Amanohashidate also had a very nice natural scenery, with the sandbar being one of the famed 3 views of Japan. This was my favorite day of the entire trip.

Tips: Having the JR West All Area Pass really made travelling easier especially with regard to as the Kyoto Tango Railway (which the pass automatically covers). Other regional passes like the JR Kansai Wide Area Pass also covers this. I would strongly recommend that you head to the nearest JR office to reserve seats for the journey to Amanohashidate especially if you are transferring at Fukuchiyama JR to the Tango railway as it requires mandatory reserved seating. Alternatively, the Hashidate Ltd Ex provides direct JR trips from Kyoto and Osaka JR to Amanohashidate JR (but the downside is that the trains leave later and you will have less time to spend in Ine/Amanohashidate). There are sea taxis giving you tours of Ine bay in Ine itself for 1000 JPY pp, which I highly recommend. Unfortunately, I had to give it a miss due to time constraints. On hindsight, I would have skipped walking on the Amanohashidate sandbar just to have more time in Ine. Lastly, Ine is in the official list of the most beautiful villages in Japan.

¬†

**Day 4: Day trip to Shimonoseki and Kokura**

Travel: \~3 hours one way (Kyoto JR --> Shin-Osaka JR via local train, Shin-Osaka JR --> Kokura JR via shinkansen, Kokura JR --> Shimonoseki JR via local train)

**Places visited**: Karato market/Iki Iki Bankangai\*, Kanmon Tunnel, Battle of Dannoura sculpture, Mojiko Retro, Tanga market

Description: Our furthest day trip yet, hitting Kyushu from Kyoto. We reached Shimonoseki at about 1030hrs. We wanted to experience Iki Iki Bankangai, which turned out to be quite fun. However, prices were not as low as what we expected from reading online reviews. It‚Äôs not overrated but it‚Äôs also not the most spectacular. The sashimi servings are generous though and the deep fried fugu and miso soup were hits too. We then made our way to Kanmon Tunnel, an underground tunnel connecting Honshu to Kyushu. When we crossed over to the Kyushu side, we happened to spot wild dolphins swimming in the Kanmon Strait, which we believe to be a rare occurrence. We were really grateful for this experience! We then took a bus down to Mojiko Retro (which we did not spend much time at), and then a JR train from Mojiko back to Kokura JR. From there we walked to Tanga Market and reached an hour before closing time. It was an interesting market with significant history but once again, it‚Äôs not any different from any other local Japanese market. We headed back to a mall near Kokura JR, and had our dinner there before heading back to Kyoto.

Vibe: What was most memorable was perhaps eating sashimi with a sea/bridge view as well as dolphin spotting. That was really relaxing. Otherwise, with all due respect, Shimonoseki is quite ‚Äúindustrial or bare‚Äù in my opinion compared to places like Hiroshima or Ine, but there is nothing wrong about that. There is also an aquarium in Shimonoseki which houses many types of pufferfish but we decided to skip it. Shimonoseki is famed for its pufferfish.

Tips: Iki Iki Bankangai only opens on the mornings of Friday, Saturday and Sunday (please double check this information). It may be a good idea to skip Tanga market and spend more time at Mojiko Retro. If you are not a big fan of pufferfish sashimi, I would recommend you to use to this day to travel elsewhere.

¬†

**Day 5: Day trip to Fukui**

Travel: \~3.5 hours one way (Kyoto JR --> Tsuruga JR via Ltd Ex, Tsuruga JR --> Fukui JR via shinkansen, Fukui Echizen station --> Katsuyama Echizen station via Echizen Railway (non JR), then a local bus from Katsuyama station --> Fukui Prefectural Dinosaur Museum)

**Places visited**: Fukui Prefectural Dinosaur Museum (FPDM)\*\*

Description: Headed out really early for Fukui. Fukui JR is beautifully designed, with dinosaur motifs, sculptures, and life-sized models just outside the station area. Just next to Fukui JR, is the Fukui Echizen station, where we took the Echizen railway to Katsuyama station. The Echizen railway was an interesting experience, plowing deep into the countryside, traversing in between houses at times. While it was not the most easiest of routes to navigate, we just followed the crowd and eventually reached the museum. The museum itself was quite huge, with large outdoor spaces (which we did not have time to explore). There were at least 10 genuine fossils in the museum itself and we felt that the museum did a very good job of presenting these fossils and imparting knowledge to visitors. We spent about 3-4 hours there and had our lunch, before heading back early to Kyoto to rest.

Vibe: Very out of the way, deep in the countryside. The museum was world class however, so if you are a fan of dinosaurs, do consider coming. Fun fact: Fukui is the least visited prefecture in Japan by International tourists according to statista!

Tips: The Fukui Echizen station sells unlimited rides to/from Katsuyama Echizen station and unlimited bus rides to/from FPDM at 1700 JPY. That will cover both your journey to FPDM and back to fukui echizen station (and is more worth than buying the tickets separately).

¬†

**Day 6: Rest day in Kyoto**

Description: We originally wanted to make a day trip to Tottori, but we shelved it as we were all physically drained. We were on 4-5 hours of sleep from days 1-5 and decided to sleep in. We largely stayed in the Airbnb till about 1700hours, after which we headed out for dinner before retiring early for the night

Tips: Please do not make the mistake of packing the itinerary too much. We wanted to make the most use of the JR West All Area Pass, and eventually we did break even by at least 50000 JPY pp largely through taking many shinkansen trips. However, I learnt through the hard way that this would take a toll on the body.

Note: I do have the research needed to get to Tottori via public transport and places of interests there, so feel free to ask me if anything!

¬†

(Days 7-8: Stayed at Takayama)

**Day 7: Takayama**

Travel: \~4 hours (Kyoto JR --> Tsuruga JR via Ltd Ex, Tsuruga JR --> Toyama JR via shinkansen, Toyama JR --> Takayama JR via Ltd Ex)

**Places visited**: Frespo Hida-Takayama, Takayama Old Town\*\*, Nakabashi Bridge\*\*, Hidatakayama Town Museum, Takayama City Library\*\*

Description: The day of our transfer from Kyoto to Takayama. Although the trip was long, the scenic train ride on the Hida Ltd Ex from Toyama JR to Takayama JR made it all worth it. We managed to see the ice-capped Japanese Alps, rivers, dams and forests. On reaching Takayama, we had Hida Beef curry for lunch, and then headed to frespo for some shopping. We checked in at 1500hrs, then headed out to explore the old town area, which was extremely well preserved and beautiful. We did some shopping here and bought some sake! I especially loved the slow moving river teeming with koi, the iconic red Nakabashi bridge, and the chill vibes. We also explored the Hidatakayama Town Museum (which was FOC), and briefly visited (and admired) the architecture of the City Library. We got bento sets from konbinis for dinner, which we then ate in our Airbnb.

Vibe: Very nice and preserved old town, which gave a very nostalgic feel. It is less crowded as compared to Kyoto‚Äôs Higashiyama. Takayama was my favorite place to stay in this trip.

Tips: Sit on the left side of the Hida Ltd Ex when travelling from Toyama JR --> Takayama JR to see the Japanese Alps on a clear day. In Takayama, many eateries close really early, hence we had to resort to bento sets from konbinis. Also, streets in certain parts of Takayama may not be lighted well at night, so please watch for your safety. As Takayama is in mountainous region, it can be quite chilly even in summer on some days (16 degrees celsius even in June).

¬†

**Day 8: Day trip to Shirakawago**

Travel: \~1.5 hours one way (charted bus to/from Shirakawago, from Takayama bus terminal)

**Places visited**: Shirakawago\*\*\*, Ogimachi bridge\*\*

Description: We woke up to a rainy day and headed to Miyagawa morning market. Unfortunately, due to the heavy rain, not many stalls were open. We had hida beef ramen at a nearby restaurant as early lunch, before heading to Takayama bus terminal. We took a chartered bus (which we prebooked a month in advance) from there to Shirakawago and reached around noon. We first hiked up to the observatory deck, and bought some ice cream from the caf√© so we could chill at the viewing area and enjoy the view (its an exclusive seating area for customers). Alternatively, the other side of the observatory deck is FOC. We then hiked back down to where the Gassho-zukuri were and just enjoyed meandering around, taking photos etc. There was a lily pond, house museums opened to the public for a fee, a huge bridge over the river, and an open air museum (which was closed unfortunately due to a bear sighting). My family just sat at the riverside for close to an hour just chilling and enjoying the vibes, and taking many photos of the koi, trees, fields and Gassho-zukuri. We finally took the bus departing at \~1730 to Takayama bus terminal. We had MacDonald‚Äôs for dinner, which was really enjoyable even for my mum which says a lot!

Vibe: In the midst of nature, and history, especially since many of these houses are preserved for hundreds of years. Think of drains teeming with koi fish, sparrows flying around, the rush of the river and a village set in the middle of mountains, tucked away from most of civilisation. That‚Äôs Shirakawago. It is also a UNESCO world heritage site.

Tips: Please book the chartered bus at least 3 weeks in advance online, to avoid missing out on a seat! Also, it is good to use either Takayama or Kanazawa as a base to travel to Shirakawago via chartered bus. You may want to consider travel packages that also bring you to Gokayama, but the downside is that you will have to follow their timings strictly. Some people approach Shirakawago with a mindset of completing activities/conquering places of attractions, and complete exploring it in 2-3 hours. In my opinion, coming with a mindset just to enjoy the nature and the vibes, you could easily spend 5-6 hours here. My second favorite place after Ine/Amanohashidate.

¬†

(Days 9-11: Stayed at Nagoya)

**Day 9: Nagoya**

Travel: \~2.5 hours (Takayama JR --> Nagoya JR via Ltd Ex)

**Places visited**: Toyota Commemorative Museum, Osu Shotengai

Description: We transferred to Nagoya in the morning and reached in time for lunch, which was a delightfully huge bowl of Tempura soba, cooked to perfection. We left our luggage with the hotel, before taking the Meitetsu railway down to Toyota Commemorative Museum. The museum was informative (many English descriptions) ¬†and interactive (many machines you can see in action) and we learnt much about the textile and car industry, as well as the history of its founder. That being said, for those who do not appreciate cars nor textile production that much, you may not enjoy the experience at all. We took a train back to Osu Shotengai area for dinner, before heading back to the hotel early

Vibe: Nagoya felt really citylike. Saw caged futsal courts under flyovers/next to highways where youth were playing football, which gave me the impression of a youthful, vibrant city. Also saw way more ethnicities and nationalities in the city, which gave me the impression that Nagoya is really accepting of diversity.

Tips: Portions are generally huge in Nagoya! If you are a huge fan of cars and contemplating whether to visit the commemorative museum or the automobile one, I would suggest you visit the latter as it would have a significantly larger collection of cars. Other museums you may like to consider are the Tokugawa Art Museum or the City Science Museum (which we unfortunately did not have time to go).

¬†

**Day 10: Day trip to Sekigahara and Gifu city**

Travel: \~1 hour one way (Nagoya JR --> Sekigahara JR via local train)

**Places visited**: Yanagibashi market, Sekigahara Battlefield Memorial Museum\*\*, Gifu City Tower 43\*, Nagara/Nagaragawa river (Ukai fishing)\*\*\*

Description: We had breakfast at the hotel before heading out to explore Yanagibashi market. Saw lots of fresh fish, huge tuna fish and bonito flakes made on the spot (which we bought eventually on our last day in Nagoya for a really good price). We then made our way to Sekigahara Battlefield Memorial Museum, which was adjacent to the JR station. The museum was set literally in the very battlefield where the Battle of Sekigahara was fought about 400 years ago. Although the museum was not the biggest, it was well thought out and the brief theatre experience/animations were really well done with English translations. The top level of the museum was a lookout point towards the battlefield, with explanations on the camping points of the different armies and landmarks. There was also an interactive portion of the museum where you could play virtual games and dress up as samurai. There were also some artifacts that were preserved and displayed from the battlefield. We had lunch at the museum caf√©, before heading out to the battlefield on foot to explore. We managed see Ieyasu‚Äôs final encampment site, the battlefield monument and pass by some tombs belonging to fallen samurai (there are a total of about 12 sites but due to time constraints only did 3). We then took the local train to Gifu JR, and took the lift up Gifu City Tower 43 (the tower was literally next to the station). Tower 43 provided a bird‚Äôs eye view of the city FOC, and we could seeing the Nagara river, the surrounding mountains and the Gifu castle. Using the toilet was also memorable, with a window giving you an amazing view while you got down to business. We then went to a nearby mall for dinner, before taking a local bus out from the Gifu Bus terminal to Nagara/Nagaragawa River. We sat at the riverside and watched Ukai fishing FOC. While the boats were far away at first, we got a close up view towards the end (when the fisherman intentionally steered towards our side of the river). It was surreal- the crackling of fire, the cormorants splashing in the water and the gentle caress of the wind. We left for Nagoya at about 2100hrs, and had a late night supper of fried chicken at a restaurant/bar before retiring for the night.

Vibe: As someone who appreciates history, going to Sekigahara was amazing. If you are a history buff, then this is a place for you where you can not only learn about one of Japan‚Äôs most significant battles and the famed Tokugawa Shogunate, but also walk on the very ground of the historic battle. It was awesome to learn about the events at Sekigahara, before we visited Nijo and Himeji Castle in the latter part of our trip, which added to our understanding (and consequently experience). Watching ukai fishing in Gifu city, a tradition at least 1200 years old, was magical to say the least. We almost shelved plans due to concerns of how to get there, but we were glad we changed our minds.

Tips: You can prebook reservations for the theatre experience in the Sekigahara Battlefield Museum online. There are maps on the various sites you can visit in the surrounding battlefield at the museum, and the staff will explain to you the recommended route if you ask. If you are would like to watch Ukai fishing from the riverside, please head to the tourist information centre in Gifu JR station. In my opinion, watching from the riverside FOC is good enough and you do not not need to spend to take a boat to view Ukai. The staff will give you a map showing the regions of the river you can sit at and explain which buses to take to Nagara/Nagaragawa river. Do stay till the end of the fishing, where the Ukai boats will come really close to the riverside where you can take closeup shots and videos (without flash).

¬†

**Day 11: Day trip to Mitsui Nagashima Jazz Dream Outlet**

Travel: \~1.5hours one way (chartered bus from Nagoya Meitetsu Bus Center)

Description: Shopping, shopping and more shopping. Vans selling shoes with pries as low as 1000 JPY, factory outlets of sports/lifestyle brands like Nike and Adidas also have really good prices. However, luxury stores did not seem to have any significant sales ongoing.

Tips: You can head to Meitetsu Bus Center to buy tickets directly to the Mitsui Nagashima Jazz Dream Outlet. Do note that this is the biggest Mitsui outlet in Japan. There is also a theme park next to it (Nagashima Spa Land), famous for rides such as the Steel Dragon 2000. From my experience, prices at Mitsui (I have also been to the outlet in Sapporo) are unbeatable when it comes to brands like Nike, Adidas, New balance etc.

(Days 12-17: Stayed at Kobe)

**Day 12: Nagoya and Kobe**

Travel: \~3 hours (chartered bus from Nagoya Meitetsu center --> Kobe)

**Places visited**: Mirai Tower, Oasis 21, Kobe Harbourland, Kobe Bay Area\*\*\*

Description: Had breakfast in the hotel before heading out to the Mirai Tower and Oasis 21 area. We did not go up the Mirai Tower, but instead chose to spend more time at Oasis 21, where we stumbled across a 3v3 basketball tournament. We ended up watching the games for close to an hour FOC. We also explored the Don Quijote nearby, before having lunch at Saizeriya which was really enjoyable and affordable. We then checked out of our hotel in Nagoya, and took a bus from Nagoya Meitetsu center to Kobe. We reached Kobe at about 1600hrs, and checked in before heading to Harbourland for a quick dinner (a delightful set of oyakodon and soba for 1000 JPY). We walked out to the Kobe Bay Area via Gaslight Street, and it was really beautiful. The bay area was lighted up at night, and it was magical. Surprisingly, it was not crowded at all.

Vibe: Kobe Bay area and Gaslight street gives rise to a very dreamy mood/romantic atmosphere/chill vibes. If you are a couple looking for a nice spot to chill at night, this is the place. Kobe Mosaic which is just next to the bay area, has cafes such as Starbucks that open till 2200hrs. So you could take in the beautiful night views with a delicious cup of coffee. I loved the bay area so much that I did a run in the area on the following night.

Tips: Visit Kobe Bay area at night. It is way more beautiful than in daylight. Also, many stores in Harbourland close by 2000hrs, so do reach Harbourland earlier if you would like to shop.

¬†

**Day 13: Day trip to Sannomiya**

Travel: \~5min (Kobe JR --> Sannomiya JR via local train)

**Places visited**: Kobe Chinatown, Sannomiya Center Gai Shopping street, Sannomiya area\*\*

Description: Was a generally rainy day, so we postponed our original plan to go to the Nunobiki Herb Gardens. We enjoyed walking around Sannomiya shopping, walking around and eating. We had fun spotting random spiderman figures in Sannomiya‚Äôs buildings. Came across yubari melons (2900 JPY) and Hoka running shoes (9900 JPY) sold at amazing prices. We had soup curry for lunch, which really reminded us of Hokkaido, as well as Kobe beef sukiyaki at Ishida for dinner. We had a private room to ourselves, and enjoyed the melt-in-the-mouth beef tremendously. We headed back to our hotel after dinner to rest and I did a 3km run in the Kobe bay area when the rain stopped.

Vibe: Sannomiya was bustling and teeming with tourists. There are many Kobe beef restaurants in the area. I would recommend you to have Kobe beef in Kobe, because why not? Chinatown was not too bad but a little small in my opinion.

Tips: You may want to consider Sannomiya as a wet weather plan in Kobe itself

¬†

**Day 14: Day trip to Kyoto**

Travel: \~1.5 hours one way (Kobe JR --> Kyoto JR via local train, Kyoto JR --> Saga-Arashiyama JR via local train)

**Places visited**: Togetsukyo Bridge\*, Arashiyama Bamboo Grove\*, Nijo Castle\*\*, Nishiki Market

Description: We had breakfast at the hotel before heading to Kyoto. We reached Saga-Arashiyama JR station at about 1000hrs, and walked to Togetsukyo Bridge. It looked really charming and the river was roaring. We then made our way to the Bamboo Grove, and although it was crowded it was still magnificent. Don‚Äôt let the comments that it is overrated/tourist trap dissuade you, the only reason why crowds keep coming is because of its magnificence in the first place. Crowd started to dwindle nearing 12 noon. We headed to Nijo JR for lunch, before walking to Nijo Castle. The castle was magnificent and luxurious, with gold leaves everywhere and multiple paintings of tigers and falcons. The floorboards squeaked like the bird calls of nightingales to impede assassins, and were nicknamed ‚Äúnightingale footsteps‚Äù. We had fun spotting the Tokugawa family crest (triple hollyhock) as well as the Imperial family crest (16 petal chrysanthemum) all over the palace. Subsequently, we headed to Nishiki Market for shopping and Aeon Mall for dinner. We left for Kobe at about 2000hrs.

Vibe: Really enjoyed the nature and scenery in the Arashiyama area. Nijo Castle was more magnificent and enjoyable than we expected, and we felt the weight of its preserved history. Nishiki market was bustling, but was similar to the many markets all over Japan.

¬†

**Day 15: Kobe and day trip to Himeji**

Travel: \~40 min one way (Sannomiya JR --> Himeji JR via special rapid)

**Places visited**: Nunobiki Herb Gardens\*, Himeji castle\*\*, Kokoen Gardens, Akashi Kaikyo Bridge

Description: Had breakfast in the hotel before making our way to Nunobiki Herb Gardens (we used the subway for this if I remembered correctly). We then took the ropeway up to the entrance of the gardens; we could see Nunobiki falls really clearly from the ropeway. We really enjoyed the Herb gardens, many flowers were in bloom! There were about 8 themed gardens in total. We rushed lunch at Sannomiya JR station before taking the special rapid to Himeji. We reached Himeji JR at about 1300hrs, and we could already see the castle the moment we stepped out of the station. Really loved the broad streets and pedestrian walkways in Himeji, which gave the city a very relaxed vibe. Himeji castle really lived up to its reputation and we got to walk in the western wall, climb the main keep, marvel at its beauty and take many photos. Subsequently, we rushed through Kokoen Gardens which was a nice experience but not as spectacular as we expected it to be from online reviews. We had dinner at Himeji, before dropping by Maiko JR station on the way back to Kobe to see the Akashi Kaikyo Bridge, which holds the record for the second longest suspension bridge in the world. It was nice seeing it lighted up and we stayed for awhile before making our way back to Kobe.

Vibe: Nunobiki Herb Gardens felt like a quiet and beautiful place hidden in a corner of Kobe. I really loved how beautiful and serene it was. If you love flowers and want a break from the city, do come here! Himeji has a relaxed vibe. You would see many locals jogging around in Himeji especially around the castle moat in the evening. Streets are broad and not as crowded, which is a welcome break from the usual hustle and bustle of other cities. However, other than the castle, there may not be many other ‚Äútourist attractions‚Äù to check off in Himeji if that‚Äôs your thing. That being said, Himeji Castle is probably the most beautiful original castle in Japan, and it is a UNESCO heritage site.

Tips: There is an alternative option of hiking up/down to the Nunobiki Gardens. If you do so, you would be able to see the Nunobiki falls and dams up close. Would advise you to visit Akashi Kaikyo Bridge before sunset, as the light up at night is decent (not spectacular) and there are things to do in the area while the sun is still up.

¬†

**Day 16: Day trip to Wazuka and Dotonbori**

Travel: \~3 hours one way (Kobe JR --> Osaka JR via special rapid, Osaka JR --> Kamo JR via rapid train, local bus from Kamo bustop --> Wazuka Yama-no-ie bustop)

**Places visited**: Wazuka\*\*\*, Wazuka-cha caf√©\*, Skycafe\*\*, Dotonbori\*\*

Description: We had breakfast at the hotel before leaving for the Kobe Bay area again. We managed to see a submarine docked in the bay area, as well as a wild cormorant fishing in its waters. We then took the train to Kamo JR station, which went really deep into Kyoto countryside. Once we reached Kamo, we had lunch at Raja‚Äôs (which served Nepalese fare) and enjoyed it thoroughly. We then took bus number 65 or 66 (can‚Äôt remember clearly) from the bustop just outside Kamo JR station to Wazuka Yama-no-ie. Bustop (bus frequency every hour, trip took 15 min). We made it to Wazuka at about 1330hrs. We headed straight for Wazuka-cha caf√© and bought some snacks. At the same time, we managed to book a slot at Skycafe for an hour (essentially a private room/house overlooking the green tea fields of Wazuka), and brought our snacks up there to enjoy while admiring the scenery. It was truly amazing. Unfortunately, we did not have much time to walk around and explore the Ishitera Tea plantation up close and we headed for Dotonbori at about 1600hrs. We reached Dotonbori at about dinnertime and had a great time shopping, taking photos of the Glicoman and exploring. We had a hearty dinner there before heading back to Kobe.

Vibe: Wazuka is really deep in countryside Kyoto, and it is a scenic, untouched region of nature. Some bustops are literally a wooden pole next to an obscure bridge with a signboard. That‚Äôs the beauty and charm of Wazuka. Furthermore, if you really love green tea, Wazuka is the place to visit! The cafes/shops all sell a wide range of green tea products and store owners are extremely knowledgeable about their products. Lastly, Wazuka is also in the official list of the most beautiful villages of Japan. Dotonbori was really bustling and crowded, but we enjoyed the energy of the (youthful) crowd. The canal and Glicoman were nice, but we did not stay too long as it was getting crowded.

Tips: Other than cafes, you can walk around Wazuka to view the tea plantations, of which Ishitera Tea plantation is the most renowned. However, do note that you are not allow to walk into the plantations itself. Another day trip option that may be easier than Wazuka for green tea lovers would be Uji.

¬†

**Day 17: Flight back to Singapore**

Description: Took the JR local train from Kobe to Osaka, before taking the Haruka Ltd Ex to KIX.

Tips: We tried to avoid the morning rush hour crowd on the train (about 0800hrs-1000hrs) since we had luggage. We also tried to book reserve seats at the back of the cabin in the Ltd Ex, so that we could conveniently stow our luggage in the spaces just behind our seats.

¬†

**Lessons learnt:**

1)¬†¬†¬† Don‚Äôt pack the itinerary too much. We learnt from our mistakes in the first 7 days where we tried to make full use of the JR West All Area pass by being overly ambitious, and while we did enjoy it, it ultimately took a toll on our physical health. Instead, we could have made it slightly more relaxed or inserted a free and easy day in the middle for rest.

2)¬†¬†¬† Not to take the train during morning or evening rush-hour if we could help it. Especially if we had luggage which would make entering trains really difficult. In the worst case scenario, the extreme front or end of the cabins would be the best bet space wise.

3)¬†¬†¬† JR trains experience delays fairly commonly, and hence to account for this in planning activities. We experienced delays lasting for at least 30 min at least 3 times during the trip, and almost had our train service suspended once due to an earthquake. Be prepared for this to happen and always have a back-up plan

4)¬†¬†¬† While Jorudan and Google maps can be helpful, they are not always 100% accurate especially when delays occur and the tracks to wait for the designated train changes. In such scenarios, it is advisable to confirm/clarify with the staff.

5)¬†¬†¬† Sometimes, (chartered) buses may be a viable, more convenient and affordable alternative to JR trains. This is especially true when taking buses out of Nagoya‚Äôs Meitetsu Center to other regions of Japan.

6)¬†¬†¬† A wise way to plan a trip around JR public transportation in future would be to select an appropriate pass, identify the places/prefectures of interest covered by the pass, and then plan accordingly from there.

¬†

**General Tips:**

1)¬†¬†¬† Do stay near main JR stations (within walking distance) if you rely heavily on public transport. Airbnb and business hotels do provide such accommodations at reasonable prices if you are willing to sacrifice some comfort/living space.

2)¬†¬†¬† It is advisable to live near Shin-Osaka station (or all the ‚ÄúShin‚Äù stations) if you are planning to use the bullet train frequently, this will save your time having to take a local train to a station that has shinkansen services/reduce your chances of missing a shinkansen if the preceding local train experiences delays.

3)¬†¬†¬† Do check out the regional passes which may provide way more value and savings than the Nationwide JR pass. Url here: https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2357.html. You can total up the cost of individual tickets using sites like Jorudan and then find out if getting a regional pass is worth it.

4)¬†¬†¬† You can book reserved seats unlimited times for free when you get certain regional passes (do check the details). Hence, do head to the nearest JR ticket office in the first few days of your arrival in Japan to do so. Do note there is a cap of 4 trips you can book a reserved seat for each time you queue in order to facilitate the progress of the queue. Hence, all you need to do is to queue, book reserved seats for 4 trips, queue up again, and repeat the process till you are done. My family reserved seats for about 20 trips under the JR West All Area pass, and we queued about 4-5 times.

5)¬†¬†¬† If you have luggage with you and are thinking of reserving seats in a JR Ltd Ex train, do ask the staff to reserve the seats at the back (at no additional cost) so you have the extra space behind the seats to stow you luggage. Likewise, if you are bringing oversized luggage onboard a shinkansen, you can do this.

6)¬†¬†¬† Google translate was a savior especially when we had to decipher information at bustops, speak to JR staff and ask for help.

7)¬†¬†¬† Do keep loose change with you if you are travelling on a local bus without a SUICA card. It is recommended to know how to use the coin change machine at the front of the bus in case you run out of loose change. You can find many YouTube tutorials on this!

8)¬†¬†¬† Always know the days of the week that attractions are closed and if there are any public holidays during your visit which may result in the attraction being closed. You can find information on Japan public holidays through a quick google search online.

9)¬†¬†¬† Please bring enough water especially if you travel in summer. My family travelled in summer and we would never fail to carry (me and my brother took turns) two extra 1.5L bottles of water in addition to our personal water bottles.

¬†

Thank you for your time in reading this! I appreciate any questions, and constructive feedback and criticism! Happy travels :)

Soli Deo Gloria

¬†",https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1fgsk9j/trip_report_family_trip_to_kyoto_takayama_nagoya/,Thank for the detailed post about your experience. I really liked reading about your travels to hidden gems beyond the golden route. We are leaving for Japan next week so this is super appreciated. We ended up taking off Amanohashidate¬†due to its distance so I am living vicariously through you!,"Cool report. The first days look like all of my visits to Japan. Great that your mother was able to keep up.

Last year when I got out of Nagashima Spa Land I walked around Nagashima Jazz Dream Outlet and did not find good prices in Adidas. It probably depends on when you visit. The mall structure is disappointing to stroll around because it looks like an old USA outlet (I thought the same about Mitsui Outlet Park Makuhari). There's also Nabana no Sato flower park on that island, part of the Nagashima complex along with the theme park, water park and resort.

Tip 3: no need to be calculating everything on your own. The same website you posted has a calculator that checks all of the passes: [https://www.japan-guide.com/railpass/](https://www.japan-guide.com/railpass/)

Tip 4: you don't need to go to a ticket office to make a reservation. You can do it on vending machines, which almost never have people queuing. 

Tip 7: the main tip should be: always travel with a loaded SUICA because it's awfully convenient (though you also need to have cash). It's a nuisance for others if you're fumbling with the cash in order to pay in buses, stores or wherever. The Japanese like to do everything quick and you'd also be stalling the bus and people behind you.","Awww I just moved back from Nagoya after living there for a year and a half, and that portion of your report made me feel quite nostalgic/‚Äúhomesick‚Äù. ‚ò∫Ô∏è Glad you enjoyed!!","Ohhhh amazing and detailed report, thank you very much!

Shir≈ç Shrine is known for its association with dogs. The shrine is dedicated to Shir≈ç, a loyal dog who lived during the Edo period.

If you find one along your travels, it would be a meaningful place to offer prayers for your dog.","(Excerpts of the Japan Guide Dog Association homepage.)

Fuji harness has a guide dog memorial monument and offers the memorial service for the deceased dogs. Kanagawa(Yokohama), Sendai, and Asahi Shimane's training center have replicas of memorial monuments, so that flowers can be handled at any time. This memorial monument has been devised so that people who are invisible and hard to see can feel the memorial monument.

do the Kiyomizu-Dera¬†first it gets busy as day goes by. 

Kimono forest is best at night time. so best to see it close to sunset so you can see it day and night. 

In arashiyama the foot traffic are mostly at the start of the path as go farther the path there would be less people. what you can do is you visit Tenryu-ji first and exit backdoor to the bamboo forest. 

in night 2. 

i would move Fushimi Inari¬†here at the start.",Night 5 sounds a bit mental to me. Doing Inari taisha to then go hike Nara park plus crawl (you don't walk there due to crowds) Dotonburi... I'd rethink.,"Most places in kyoto only open at 10/11 am, no need to get there early, such as nishiki Market.",Make sure to walk the Hankyu underground passage from Karasuma to Kawaramachi stations. they have the first four stages of mario on the wall with their respective songs.,"Night 2: I believe most shops at Nishiki Market open around 9:30/10am, so you may want to plan on arriving a bit later and visiting either Kiyomizu-dera or Fushimi Inari early that morning instead."
1feeo9i,USJ Experience: Buying a last-minute SATURDAY ticket w/ no express pass in September,"TLDR: We bought last-minute Saturday tickets at the gate (on Friday, the day before) we were worried about crowds since I've heard that you just shouldn't even try USJ on a Saturday without express passes but decided to go for it. We had the best day ever and got into Nintendo Land, rode every ride we wanted (except Demon Slayer), and had an amazing time at Halloween Horror Nights! BIGGEST TIP: You can buy tickets at the gate the day before (if your card doesn't work online like ours) so you don't have to wait in line in the morning and can make a b-line for Nintendoland before timed entry starts.

Hi everyone! I recently returned from an amazing honeymoon trip to Japan with my new(!) husband. We went to Osaka, Kyoto, and Okinawa and had an amazing time (maybe I'll do a full trip report idk). What I wanted to talk about in this post was our experience at USJ on a Saturday, during Halloween Horror Nights, with no express passes. Before deciding on Friday to go I did a lot of reading on here and other websites and the general consensus was that USJ is WAYYYY too crowded and if you go on a Saturday, good luck getting on any rides without an express pass. This put me off wanting to go but near the end of our trip we decided that we had seen enough of Osaka to be content (this was our second time there) and that USJ is cheap enough (compared to the US parks) that if it was no fun and way too busy we could just leave early. I attempted to buy tickets online but much like Tokyo Disney my card didn't work so we decided to just take the train over on Friday morning and buy Saturday tix. I recommend this!! We waited in line for about 20 minutes on Friday at 10 am for tickets but when we got to the park about an hour and 15 mins before opening on Saturday the line to buy tickets was wayyyyyy longer. if you want to make it to Nintendoland I would say definitely buy tickets in advance.

With that info out of the way here was our day with approximate wait times!

**Arrived at 6:50 AM** to get in line before the park opening. I had read online that if you make a b-line for Nintendo land at opening you can get in without timed entry, we did this and it worked!

**7:45 Entered the park:** walked at a brisk pace to Nintendoland and got right in line for Mariokart (we did single rider, posted times: SR 40 mins, Normal 70 mins, real wait: about 25 mins)

**8:20 took pics around Nintendoland**

**\~8:45 got in line for flying dinosaur:** posted time: 40 mins, real wait: about 20 mins. Literally one of THE COOLEST COASTERS I'VE EVER BEEN ON! I may have liked it even more than Velocicoaster at Universal Orlando.

**9:30 Headed to Harry Potter:** It was about 36C out so we were dying of heat, the solution...frozen butterbeer!! After we got that we shopped a bit to try and cool off and then decided to get in the 70 min line for the Hogwarts ride. The real wait was more like 50 mins.

**11:15 Got lunch at the Three Broomsticks:** Had the Halloween set and it was pretty good!

**12:15 Walked over to Hollywood Dreamer:** We did Backdrop first and the posted wait was 50 minutes I think but it was more like 25 maybe, it was wayyyy quicker than estimated. They had two Halloween exclusive songs we wanted to ride to: Kickback from Chainsaw Man and Show by Ado so we decided to do kickback for the backwards ride because it just seemed right lol.

**1:00 attempted to ride Demon Slayer:** We got the Tanjiro popcorn bucket and the soy sauce popcorn (which was delish) and then attempted to ride the Demon Slayer ride but the posted wait was 120 minutes and after barely moving in line for 30 minutes we gave up and left the line. The ride ended up shutting down later (I think it was because of HHN, not a breakdown) so we never ended up riding it but, oh well. We then did some shopping and I bought some Ado HHN merch because I'm a huge Ado fan and I love exclusive collabs.

**2:00 Rode Jaws:** I was hyped to ride Jaws since I never go to ride the one in Orlando. I was amazing and I bought a really cute Jaws sweater vest after the ride! Posted wait time: 65 mins, real wait time: 60ish mins.

**3:30 Re-rode Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey:** We enjoyed this ride so much and the posted wait time in the app was like 35 mins but when we got there the time was already up to 80. We decided to wait anyway because the line moved way faster than the posted time earlier in the day...but then the ride broke down lol. We were really close to the front as well so we were supposed to be evacuated last but that mean we sat in line for about 2 hours total. We were a bit miffed as no one was giving information in Japanese or English BUT just when we thought we were about to be evacuated the ride started up again and we got to ride!! So in reality the posted time was 80, it probably would have taken 60 if the ride didn't break down but it ended up taking 90 so really not too bad.

**5:00 Had dinner:** We had the MOST DELICIOUS Danish pizza things near the Jaws ride. OMG they were devine.

**6:00 HHN Started!** I've never been to a HHN so I was super hyped to go in Japan, I like that it wasn't a separate ticketed event, it was just included in our 10,000 yen admission. And it was SO FUN. The Zombie costumes were unreal and the actors made it so fun, I liked the Blue Rose Protection Force too and how they played Ado music throughout the evening. There was this huge concert with these creepy/cute bear things and Ado (she wasn't actually there of course) and everyone was so hype, it was a lot of fun.

**7:15 One last ride on Hollywood Dreamer:** After we had ridden the hollywood dreamer earlier in the day the wait times went up at ton, I think paybe maxxing out at 90 or 100 mins. We had hoped the wait time would go down while everyone was enjoying HHN but it only went up so we decided to just bite the bullet and get in line so that we could ride it forward and listen to Show. I'm so glad we did because the way the ride is lit up at night was a totally different and amazing experience! NOTE: Make sure you check which song number the song you want is by referencing the seat back in front of you because they change the song list between the forward and backward cars and Show went from song #2 backwards to song #5 forwards!

**8:45 Time to head out:** At this point we had been at the park for like almost 14 hours and we were pretty wiped so we went home and enjoyed the public baths at our hotel. The hot water was heaveny on my sore feet \*(\*we did about 26k steps that day so we were pretty tired, especially after a few weeks of 20-30K + steps a day lol)

Anyway that was our early Septemer Saturday at USJ. It was absolutely amazing and I think as long as you acknowledge the crowds and enjoy yourself it is totally doable without an express pass!",https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1feeo9i/usj_experience_buying_a_lastminute_saturday/,"> The hot water was heaveny on my sore feet *(*we did about 26k steps that day so we were pretty tired, especially after a few weeks of 20-30K + steps a day lol)

I remember not quite understanding the appeal of hot springs/onsen the first time I was in Japan. It's just some hot water baths, nice but nothing particularly special.

But I instantly got the appeal when I tried an onsen after some very busy days with well over 30k+ steps each day.

Hot springs are amazing after an physically-intense day, any soreness basically just melts away. I also ended up really liking the hot spring water foot baths that could sometimes be found near volcanos and mountains in Japan.","that actually sounds really reasonable!

1f98xvw,16 Day Itinerary Check: Tokyo > Kyoto > Osaka > Tokyo,"Hello everyone, I‚Äôm traveling to Japan in November for the first time. This will be my second overseas trip traveling solo. I‚Äôve got a very loose itinerary and I‚Äôm open to any kinds of suggestions of things to do, places to stay, things to avoid, etc. Some of the days are pretty sparse. I haven‚Äôt booked my accommodations yet, so I can also add or subtract days in the cities I‚Äôm going to.

A little bit about me as a traveler: I‚Äôm a very laid back person and pretty easy to please when I travel, I‚Äôm honestly just happy to be in another country exploring. Just walking around for hours looking at architecture is good enough for me. I don‚Äôt need very niche and unique experiences to be packed into every hour of the day, but at the same time I‚Äôm also not opposed to the hustle and bustle required to fit a lot in a day. 

I don‚Äôt have this on my itinerary, but I‚Äôm considering taking some time to see Himeji castle. Maybe I should add another day in Osaka for that? 

Looking forward to your feedback. Thanks!

It‚Äôs just a bunch of tourists taking selfies and getting drunk. Locals, for the most part, do not speak English (much) and are not interested in chatting with tourists.

You have day 7 backwards. Doing all of that and then hitting Fushimi will just put you in the tourist masses. Go really early or late.","Hiroshima + Miyajima in one day is very difficult and not recommended. 

If possible, spend a night in Hiroshima to properly explore the city and also visit Miyajima early in the morning on the first ferry to beat the crowds. 

Also, to go from Osaka to Hiroshima there is a Hello Kitty Shinkansen. 
It‚Äôs worth taking it.","I've lived in Japan for 20 years.  Mostly in Tokyo.  It looks like a nice trip.  A few things...

* In Shinjuku, if you like parks, Shinjuku Gyoen is a nice one. It's a bit from the main station and there is actually a station dedicated to it.  It's a structured park - very planned but quite nice.  Also, you can wander around sanchome back behind H&M which has some nice restaurants, or Kabukicho.  I don't know what effect the more recent over tourism (not your fault) has had on the area but I've liked that area.  
* In Kyoto, one of your days looks a bit light.  Personally, I like Zen temples and Ryoanji has always been a favorite.  There is also an option to go out to Hozugawa Kudari  which I find relaxing and it brings you out over by Arashiyama.
* When you come back to Tokyo, you could potentially go out to Kamakura, or, Yokohama.  Kamakura has a road with a bunch of vendors and shops, some great shrines and temples and the Great Buddha.  Yokohama has Chinatown and the bay area.
* Shibuya....uggh.  Imagine if you said to your friends in your country, ""let's go to the corner and walk across the street and take a picture!"".  But I understand, you almost need to go so you can tell your friends.  Personally, my least favorite part of Japan. Not Tokyo. Like...Japan.  Young people love it though.
* If you get bored or tired, especially in places like Shinjuku and Ginza, try out an older cafe/cake shop. It's something I have always liked.  I can't recommend a place because I am not sure what is still open.  But don't be afraid to just go in and point.  

Good luck and have fun!","Great list so far.

Some recommendations:

*Temple ""Stamps"".*  
Most temples have a monk that uses caligraphy to place a ""Stamp"" in your Stamp book. A really unique souvenir and a great way to recollect which route you took and the temples you viewed.

Some examples: [https://matcha-jp.com/en/10460](https://matcha-jp.com/en/10460)

When visiting the Imperial Palace in **Tokyo**, try and time it with the free tour that is available twice a day.  
This will grant you access to the otherwise closed grounds for free (limited tickets available, first come first serve)

Have a look at [https://sankan.kunaicho.go.jp/english/about/koukyo.html](https://sankan.kunaicho.go.jp/english/about/koukyo.html) for the schedule, take your passport with you!

If you are feeling adventurous consider renting a bike for 2 days in **Kyoto**. Split the city in 2 ""routes"" and bike everywhere. Would depend on the weather though, but that would offer you some different views than going by triain/bus. Pickup around Hachijo West Gate of Kyoto station. EA bike, [https://kyoto-option.com/english/shop/flagship/](https://kyoto-option.com/english/shop/flagship/)¬†

Eastern day: - Sanjusangendo - Kiyomizudera temple - Higashiyama street - Kodaiji temple - Yasaka shrine - Park through to Keage slope - Heian shrine ‚Äì Ginkakuji

Northwest day: - Togetsukyo bridge - Tenryu temple - Arashiyama Bamboo path - Gio moss temple - Otagi Nenbutsu temple - Kinkakuji temple

Both routes are of course also possible in reverse order.

*And save Fushimi Inari for the evening* when its dark. Walk all the way to the top of the mountain. Lovely quiet, well lit and nice viewpoints. Possible wild boars!

Maybe swap out Day 11 in **Osaka** for a daytrip to Nara?

JR Nara Line Rapid / Local \~50 min

Lots of deer! Eating (Kuzu) Mochi! Isui-en Garden, Todaiji Temple, Kofukuji Pagoda.

In Osaka itself: Umeda Sky Building viewpoint (bring binoculars/camera with 5x-10x optical zoom so you can see the highway through the Gate Tower building https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gate\_Tower\_Building)

Day 15 **Tokyo**:

Day trip to Nikko. Despite the fact that you have seen many temples in Kyoto, these are worth it.

Beautiful colors, detailed wood carvings, gold leaf, glitter, everything üòä

There is also a lake nearby with a waterfall: ""Lake Chuzenji and Kegon falls"", is a separate bus trip with many hairpin bends. In my opinion something like a half hour drive.

And an extra bonus tip when you want to be frugal in **Tokyo**:  
Take a helicopter flight over the largest city in the world (great at night/sundown):

Be prepared to cut some things from your list if you find you can't keep up.,"It seems like you've done a lot of research.

What part of town are you staying in? Presuming Ueno/Asakusa area? Think about visiting Kappabashi, where you can get everything from cookware to utensils to that fake plastic food you see outside restaurants.

Some of your days sound a bit action-packed. Try to budget in a little more time to get lost, you know? Spend a little more time in Akihabara, for example.

Speaking of Akiba, many stores have duty-free shopping if you spend more than 5001 JPY on consumable goods (i.e. KitKats) or 10,001 JPY on non-consumable goods (i.e. cameras) and show your passport. Stores like Yodobashi and Akky have multilingual staff and international models and all of that. The catch is that consumables have to stay sealed in the bag until you are out of the country (non-consumables can be used in Japan for up to six months), and you should keep your receipt should anyone ask for it. I know you said you're not huge on shopping but just FYI.

Mori Art Museum is a great decision. What other museums did you have in mind?

You've got a lot of observation decks in your itinerary and some of those like Skytree and the Tower are a tiny bit tourist-trappy.

See if there's anything in Odaiba that interests you.

Kunaicho runs [English-language tours](https://sankan.kunaicho.go.jp/multilingual/lang/en/information.html) of palace grounds in both Tokyo and Kyoto. I did the tour of the Kyoto palace. I recommend it.

Generic advice: Check Time Out Tokyo or something for shows that might be going on. However, tickets to Japanese shows are notoriously tough to get unless you are physically in Japan.

I wish you had time to work in Osaka. That's a really fun city. If I could compare it to another city, it would be Chicago. It makes sense; they're literally sister cities.","We did Tokyo last. That‚Äôs my recommendation because that‚Äôs where all the shopping is. You are going to be lugging around all the stuff you bought. Do Kyoto, Osaka, then Tokyo. Trust me.","Nice itinerary! I would skip Ginza as it is packed with the awful kind of tourists and would suggest to go to Omotesando instead. For Kyoto, please don‚Äôt forget Ginkakuji as it is beautiful. You packed your days quite a lot but as you are traveling alone, you can decide what to skip or where to stay longer spontaneously- and if you don‚Äôt mind walking and painful feet: All good :-) Enjoy your trip!",

Took the first train out from Osaka at 0630 to Kanazawa via the limited express *Thunderbird* for a 3 hours ride. I would note that at this early timing, the train shops that sell bentos are NOT OPEN this early so do get something to bite on from Lawsons or a 7-11. Additionally, as of March 2024 *Thunderbird* ends at Fukui and you‚Äôll need to transit via Shinkansen over to [Kanazawa ](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgQIwMIfVE48Uv9oyZfQ9saQcUMGZw_4JxYdeD72Zdel3WWptx0SVOxrT84gdWb7gW-szU33RZkkjgjEUgRk1-TWAyRnYj3xI4XWbBHhfr43XZC_Jxm4kEg3ReO3QT9ZeSHNiy8yLF0N8n2kBljqy1VqavPNZWfJRQubzOKk_aSgEPAo9KjJTzh2g4hICI/s4032/IMG_4127.JPG)instead (which is sort of a bummer since you‚Äôll need to make a train transfer, but presumably it‚Äôll be faster overall).

-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† A visit to Yuwaku Onsen on the outskirts in the afternoon. Access to Yuwaku Onsen via bus is limited to once every 1-2 hours. Wanted to explore for primarily anime reasons ([*Hanasaku Iroha*](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjHVMSIv9S0FWTzfYQg00sIYevd4iw5NKX7CUq4CVTlE6Rw882hHLfnQOvQDzAxYFlAFUjrUI4K4lOWISNVviUIPXAhk0ujiH69j-XqAYpl1c1Da1rtCHI1ZUreiP8epE8p1xMZcER4kRemCsMbliPF3oKjgZ_ay1MYQNyHM9bZ-CHnHZb9j3P4YxwtP1E/s4032/IMG_4321.JPG)*)* but I enjoyed soaking in the foot bath (bring your towel or buy one from the nearby shop) and walking around the town.

It exudes that feeling of vibrancy and warmth which most libraries do not have (in general, libraries are usually ‚Äòstale‚Äô and ‚Äòmute‚Äô, at least for me). Additionally, I do like how the designers integrate study spaces within the library. I spent about 2 hours till closing relaxing at the library. Worth a visit, if you are into architecture.

The hotel for the next 3 nights was the *Hotel Forza Kanazawa*, which was directly opposite Omicho Market, and several bus stops away from the main shopping district *Korinbo*.

Morning half day-trip to Shirakawago via highway bus, followed by a continuation of Kanazawa exploration in the afternoon.

Reserved a return ticket for the Shirakawago express bus via phone for free (with help from a friend) as I had the Takayama-Hokuriku Area tourist pass \[they do get sold out so reserve ahead of time if possible. The 0810 bus I took was full\]. Took about 1.5 hours from Kanazawa to Shirakawago. I spent 2 hours here before having to catch the return bus back to Kanazawa.

-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Look at the [three houses](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhWJ7XonCJaYoIWujYzSvMdi-yufRcFMiRgD1QYslAGL4H-BnCRGAF8H-evXVYgRhM0oKf0p31fnJn19C0ZfwTnCHZe39yDLwYefgznHHcVFlHOu9qdEEbBz8xt_CASxcjVYQ-D4bmUw0vAdplJcunB_FS0Fb7PdQK9pSBb-qKGA5xBNcCJYPQCeLQoEno/s4032/IMG_4871.JPG)

The (short) hike to the observatory is probably the most time consuming activity (and also physically demanding) with a bit of incline so be forewarned if you intend to do so (at least 30 minutes at a fast pace, double that if you want to take things easy). I contend that you should cater for 3\~4 hours here to do things at a more comfortable clip. And do bring a raincoat for the unexpected autumn rain - its more useful than an umbrella. The tourist center do sell raincoats if you accidentally missed it out (which I did).

Headed back to Kanazawa by 1300, had [Kanazawa Go-Go curry ](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi1lRDCUrIy06-hTreDxx4oNHGq_QDY5h5xiT3iVCbzAUqHgM0QW-V_0ulFi9WEbkVEUBOZA8rJXMkHT83AW4ugw-QacrdI2ZQIWaH4RJrb_7UTlwWLALl3q5TjE4e8Rrh_oVFlBKNovnZURsIl_WfMUnA8MTqVPhc3rL3ESXSdj01VjD3k_9tIoB3zTG4/s4032/IMG_4958.JPG)(900 yen for such a large portion), taking a break at the hotel to dry off myself (the shoe dryer was a godsend) before proceeding to explore more of Kanazawa, this time round on the ‚Äòcentre part‚Äô i.e.

I feel that [Omicho ](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhsdNrC1Gey473GfLigo_U6pNFgjSXFAaQacspA6dmt103FlrWRJG-ZrX_th3exau_ydklTN9nD1kaoSu22TXQ_2VqGRaFMT4IgmyLjr3Po0qDQ0YgUtEDcbbROWs0a64c3gI6hKwRHCTd4T2EGuDXrEKpMK9Rd4QTacC1xTixtdoCxY0Bf5xZ1G9HD3vI/s4032/IMG_4138.JPG)was a better representation of how markets in Japan are like, without the intense crowd levels. On reflection, I feel that visiting almost any other markets in Japan would be a better experience then visiting Tsukiji if one is able to explore outside of Tokyo. Prices were also generally cheaper/less marked-up compared to Tsukiji as well.¬† Had a nice bowl of seafood don for just 1.5k yen.

It‚Äôs a reconstructed castle, but nevertheless a nice detour if you have the time to spare enroute to Kenrokuen, with some history and details on the reconstruction methods used to reconstruct the castle.

Personally my attraction of choice, I had a good time just strolling in the garden and enjoying the scenery. The entire environment was just serene and evokes a sense of calm. While it wasn‚Äôt snowing yet, they had already started setting up the [tsukuba ](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgLDMM5U_OfZq1AIFAdZMFA4crQs_Zn9-lDtHaWbv-SVyw9B5QhGnERHD737rodW2Kx6NWDrdLNxs5CKj6TTRK1Xq_MiM0BWRmS8KWB5toatyPgOmS6Ky05iGfXP1sMkNIFeX1qvL7i2CsXuARXfKLuePSiIYG3Trtx1XBY1abmFoYlWFd-JBibzRAqKxc/s4032/IMG_5141.JPG)(those iconic wooden structures supporting the trees during snowfall).

-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† 21^(st) Century Museum of Contemporary Arts. I personally had a good time exploring the exhibits (which as the name suggest, has a more modern lean to it). My personal favourites were the [swimming pool exhibit](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg0QDsnUiyveatAb-D6faL5rwrm5ihOfXVnfIw30BfXHhoAGqXN8WPzJSyWVcw6SGCtddwXfWbstgD8XrXF4tL7-gKCZjEU_wL8CGMSLx1tT4KL0spTjUfMITjReMXA3O713cGVwaVV5xS7Gt0bHef4MiLjyIeUI56KKGErj6tamGmeulw91rXU4ne6nR4/s4032/IMG_5231.JPG), this [exhibit on machine learning](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi4GsJdOwJLAQidmbeAuDMQwOwG4eD2J9N_7G8O7UiOZwHkju4nyym4Fjg3K4RKbTGcIJ6aawsRRZWYAoO50WkwgYBwu-RauOjLVDOQ7a_Jjhsl99Cl6rr2hlUdICRqsUMaCEX6SU7ijbCzhtquFI0Ci2Fvqp3BKmNwwHUKsnDoGYM-1MeBRUUuSpXjFpk/s4032/IMG_5224.JPG), as well as a Twitter check mark [vending machine](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgrPlgrpLxkrQPNn_GuTHLww8osGhn1ONqfvIbBiyiWnKAQpAhsC1e1Un7XFz3PaMNB2G05MXCZY4sPAkJNYfwvs69pPt3mspUi4Cuy_BitVLCy0ZRuK4yvur4pIgxRl3dqFOGqvZw0kw_qUXxbW8vanNI7S0vroCmTL9BXV8NoON1FDBAitkfForu4S54/s4032/IMG_5262.JPG), with a 1/100 chance of it dispensing a gold-leaf tick symbol (pretty tongue-in-cheek)

**Day 27- Nanao, Kanazawa Central (Ishikawa)**

This was an unplanned day, but I decided to head over to Nanao for some anime pilgrimage (for an anime named [Insomniacs After School](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiFcKOhKmOLt3kbCeKPPOcBBV_lmna0e-mI7OOAoVsG5VhvY-JheIwOSp5kEopfFI_xI1dQ7VRey52v-IFihOE7v3YH-Fe8uv6YKJyOEAONil7DghlLiaGzpneEeCmn4FWRfhkL0B7Twuvns0Ic09dNp_wkz8OjNiis9mv8c9SszSJB-EPpgbMe-bDOwWo/s4032/IMG_5762.JPG)*)*, which was an hour away from Kanazawa via local rail. I was already planning to come here the next day, but I realized I didn‚Äôt had enough time so I decided to devote extra time here.

Renting a local electric assist bike for 1k yen at the tourism centre, I explored various spots around Nanao related to the anime. Some spots of interest (that aren‚Äôt just anime related only) are as follow:

-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Hanayomenoren Museum. A small museum featuring [bridal curtains ](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiQ0jQr1CwfhsHs2FFhEJrOZTJaAWpPyg8IjVhZsMJa6aQrf77F6Fhv-eBd1OncvIqEK3jI9eJ-2DZVZbv6l05u6TmRKStNA-K0-pixNdTJQQFYnKeRfYzCUqpzxAyQBdwBlyvRbGtp1WtCDG3hiDybdiyO4CddYiZ7Z-RlkK0Q21fpf67EVGFiFjVbcvQ/s4032/IMG_5407.JPG)and its importance for marriages in the past.

-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† [Nanao Castle Ruins](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjaBPzSaumXOOnizjmXcmLxf1w41JHYTOCZRqrfFDj5-A7lKU5HXlDqpxDyMoRme2zTGCrDyAWEQu0352v0ckjhqNbRFPfQI-BHjUEJZIzOhUq7Hjd-Ru2Pa_5KqywboBtZunlCBPOQZ8klEMzlmy3Ll7jOFREc-9tovVOZA6OKSA1bzRGWjjRAQQgbJwo/s4032/IMG_5565.JPG). Another anime-related hotspot, the cycle up is relatively easy with an e-bike, but probably better done with a car.¬† The reward for cycling up the mountain is a picturesque [view ](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiNoO41P99_ZuELoWk_rStIUrg62fK-zR6kZ2xuEhzbI4aJAcDUl0pvC5e5-9L-aDiWW7KWYTKTEuBBIvEjMIXpAiqfjJmFm83Cx6LK5bys5XFy9ieEIBDavZBYFPGkKJVHL-jq53lyy-oqE5uymIdK2b8zlGzhJifcyGaN-2JeuZoBew7CXqWEnRi89kQ/s4032/IMG_5571.JPG)of the city facing the sea.

-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Roadside Station Noto Shokusai Market (ÈÅì„ÅÆÈßÖ ËÉΩÁôªÈ£üÁ•≠Â∏ÇÂ†¥). While small, the food offerings were pretty good and affordable (the same don I had in Kanazawa was about 100-200 yen cheaper here).

-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Had some [fluffy pancake and coffee ](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhWrvweL0jHGZ29CY64XOC6sF8qizf9VtUCl41o-QlhoQ-rwEHz_woZgVVEfZix7x3NOIohh5m8Xakp99wJuHQkUeJjEmUtW64dgjMb5xfVQVJToweGoFz_x3jXxWYG66uAODxtyHYZZbj2KKZ-N5B-Kw83SnX0LlNm4nRf7XVngIBd94wLYYUual5bR8Y/s4032/IMG_5783.JPG)from a caf√© that was featured in the manga, tasted divine (*Chuoh Saroh,* ‰∏≠Â§ÆËå∂Âªä). Owner was also a big fan of the anime.

Returning to Kanazawa at night, I explored the remaining places that I have yet to do so, namely Nagamachi District and [Oyama Shrine](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj_pciLntXwNQlAt7c8gMHSROysxdGy7Q3_8-66dLcAznaVzvfzVuniVqg7prciFBqwXdm4HTjk9JmD0yIYZIqJ0TNWE3btjqR4PQRG0a1L1wpmI9ofhWftUwgtxpxTPH0g4W4A98FwjvhoTvva-wYZ10lq-bIYGHDiQAybG0wiW12jAeGEBCdkWQPLqU0/s4032/IMG_5872.JPG). I should mention that at night, both venues are already closed, but you can enter and view the grounds.

**Day 28- Wakura Onsen, Noto Peninsula (Ishikawa)**

One neat feature offered by the Ishikawa tourism centre is that they [offer same-day luggage forwarding services to any places within Ishikawa ](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgQDctFyKxjiNSdJKSZ4ajZAYuUy-JS6ovaG8HHrAt0uB1aadMM-jYfQQqDVrxLZ6JVAdwCUbvMx1_UdwvvTroy_CDR_ZhCD6rEnaXHo2nxMh2crN1TFXwJUEGijHdmyv7H7dD9WvZ8bwmw9J-yjCYUvm85rh0mjguH68X6ZYzrS2Tx_kw33hk3Xtba7oY/s4032/IMG_5818.JPG)for a nominal fee (\~900 yen) as long as you pass it to them by the cut-off timing. Availing myself with that service, I boarded the final sightseeing train of the trip, the [Hanayomenoren ](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEih_q_J4MtlqxghP7gRtPF1Cl40yeFKh2fdArvJs1B9LtGrxf8ic2APz6R5XlHQrNCRtiz5U3cGkOmuY4L40BKn1vjF_adAvnlWYDvWV3AL23tM4FWqf3T2Q_ACAK7c1e1KqjBwOPu9lPu8tJzZAczrMEdHz9fxALpeyWyVyBFo17J0nPCGkNuZXBpCGpA/s4032/IMG_5956.JPG)\*(\*related to the museum visited yesterday). The train [interior ](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjlpKiWrSGnO5BP5hOIXzw2METPsObXHiJK9ebK3gl8PSiKywHDvLV3mbRnI9OwYIRdh2n70lITYYqM1QC3LvZrSWlaGehTsyOIWmuBaKPHNHIqV9ePJvj1tvl75VkxQQyBmHUezBrMg0XGzad81yShuAj0WgobuEO6bmK8CEDVxcMfugMHTfYV1Ap6FCY/s4032/IMG_5973.JPG)is coated with gold leaf and is tastefully decorated, decorated with numerous bridal curtains. Was an enjoyable 1.5 hour train ride over to Nanao.

I then proceeded to do some train spotting related to anime and visited some anime hotspots at Nishigishi Station before retiring at an onsen ryokan named Tadaya (ÂíåÂÄâÊ∏©Ê≥â Â§öÁî∞Â±ã) for the next two nights. Special mention for the [room ](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhn-aWGBn7pyhN-iJt4S5FbLdI_AHwUUs817Swfiqwxy8J3R9XaN0d7MMz9VMSRbHAJGrQIroeEoHsN50gz5XRkyA2OEnVu_soVcXjEMjkNRdEh_gsZ9xQvHWV46S1jhy4KMB39l9yrqwAbpAG11UgY5ua8-sMqSrXUB20FoAYjf2rgCdjwNDF2FYXAPLg/s4032/IMG_6384.JPG)which was very large for a single occupant, with a great view of the Nanao Bay in the morning. [Dinner ](https://imgur.com/a/F7zjpgv)was outstanding with a printed-out English menu spelling out what I was offered, with some uncommon cuisine such as shirako/cod milt. I thoroughly enjoyed the meal. Regrettably, as of writing, the ryokan has yet to reopen. One night (with dinner and breakfast) costed about 30k yen for one person.

**Day 29 ‚Äì Wakura Onsen, Noto Peninsula (Ishikawa)**

Had a friend who helped to drive me around Noto Peninsula. This sector should be done with a car as public transport is almost non-existent, with bus services/frequencies very limited. Some interesting visiting spots are as follow:

-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† *Noto Milk* ‚Äì a local shop specializing in milk produce. The [milk ice cream ](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhRcbIj-unc9s5m-4fmzFZA8m7tx0zS35fq1GVo5RNJQjT2rd89indAZfcLRMQse0iao3M4P29Rkaaz21IR3v2nySooPJJMBilvbx-0MzDQxy7hU3-beMRT0n4fkc9f1bU1ChbW2hVSwTA81hmuTX1QDg5yiRtQFALt7Pc0jvLgxCMQLmswQzQ_dJoZ3g8/s4032/IMG_6621.JPG)is worth the try if you come here.

-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† [Wakura Onsen Festival Halls ](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh_jGZTV3DOrn_WE1BSsF24_KaYL3QD-a8yitD9y1jLLZyALpQr2HSHwfukHyeWE3TNyhHoaC5GuureNwW2D0fbuIgil6mnkd3wahOnSFnnCn8Gzu5XtbNs-ZVLMPwqdljYJ7PW5hhEOBw5UbJ6jt6vyRdDij_pROC7lZU-HM63b6SvN94lXK9yqhWK_NM/s4032/IMG_6570.JPG)(ÂíåÂÄâÊ∏©Ê≥â„ÅäÁ•≠„Çä‰ºöÈ§®). A large museum/hall showing the local festival that they celebrate annually (they had this larger-than-life floats and a literal fire festival). Also featured in the anime incidentally.

-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† [Mawaki Site](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhCJ4rC4jx9cT8TnOvjyCPJiE6eLh37GMfhs_jjyqUaEVla0m0UnJ9INVr8M7skHs0Cm5COTmjNSsirr7sbC16FT8RgODXhqgbHiBLKj6k8b1lQZInDNpIEzSAJNrnq1LNtMpJkclH_2jfAJhmRqlaH4w2FYHGTMAxFNvk1RmUvXcooKO1DtE24L4OtKyU/s4032/IMG_6718.JPG). Allegedly the birthplace of the *jomon* people \[prehistoric people\], it sorta feels like Stonehenge for lack of a better comparison, except that its made of wood instead of stone.¬† There is also a nearby museum but we didn‚Äôt had the time for it

-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† [Mitsuke Island ](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjV-MYh61YY7vH41onD3oLngF-oA4916m54uguDuRcPW_8EQGt43LkI7q8JSCVFdBxFuGyrkaMjKfpRi-cTtn-3D-ObLCG_rHv-d5ZwNLOVwQO_B5U0Ps7aQvHZxWTiEdPJEHMRVwAKJPVqYSYkAqLYJpRzq_GiAX896OR89wNMEAYf2O8atH6WZx_YFi0/s4032/IMG_6809.JPG)(Ë¶ãÈôÑÂ≥∂). An island that is shaped like a battleship, and looks pretty imposing when you are near it. You could cross via some rocks to get close to it, though i would mention that it is not an easy task to do so. Regrettably, the island was badly damaged during the earthquake in January, and is no longer of the same size/stature that it once was.

-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† [Shiroyone Senmaida Rice Terraces ](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiYd5t9lbtsGEfTw5ooCgJ0D2PabaFafcphTR2uCXjiReFrLGv3MprglbSdwYaSwidQO3fAxyZ_H4EosKxxXVnVATHL33OQDcgDioC1W5q2jh7-THUDTVs6lpU7yc9sByTbOtdjIWMt0SS2QzGPDufPnRufN2Xeg2G_grcmHE_bRNBPvAB6Ohs5u7DbIi0/s4032/IMG_6834.JPG)(ÁôΩÁ±≥ÂçÉÊûöÁî∞) . Labelled by the UN as a Globally Important Agricultural Heritage System, the view overfacing the sea was great, though we were a bit too early to witness the night illumination (we had to leave early around 1700). The sea breeze can be a bit strong so expect a bit of a chill as you head downwards towards the sea.

On reflection, in order to explore the peninsula more thoroughly, I feel that at least 2\~2.5 days is necessary (to explore other parts such as Wajima (which is also badly affected by the earthquake). Retired at the ryokan for the night.

**Day 30 ‚Äì Noto Satoyama Airport √† Haneda Airport, Akihabara (Tokyo)**

Had yet another great [breakfast ](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEix4QeqJW1XmyYEnLLncjQAIaIuX-ps-b21fAXF8dFrVwOwjIqDglcC5ybMqvSJ7q2dJv97-Czk6op5DpeIwgSEB3W00CwnqEPPe75aSKfXvPfoKqjOT9_c5CIdVW_pOPSdskGqrg76kuPxwsNWd3RkrITUFkWUmeC4rWHdNRMFtcIuLJ-Sg1Klf6Cd7a0/s4032/IMG_6968.JPG)in the ryokan before checking out and heading towards the nearest domestic airport ([Noto Satoyama Airport](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjKrB6HJ1UQh3fwYtpC5mWMxlRLB_mMsPHINUywksVshKNPAgG8q1YHz0DTeuYrY1CuSiFi6CqINv170ZtaUT9bFafoTuDVcRqvPGSzFOyn5vNnXYtG3Yyaa-sQLaPR3UCuy4rRd6xUT83ifM2g9OVYNWvSUHpgza_pVTGdvCSpQ3omCjukriqxxSkvFRk/s4032/IMG_6998.JPG)). A neat service provided by the local airport to residents/tourists on Noto Peninsula is a dedicated taxi service from the ryokan to the local airport at a flat fee of 1500 yen. Together with the flight ticket at 10k yen, it was considerably cheaper and faster to take a domestic flight to Haneda instead of taking the Shinkansen via Kanazawa (was about 15\~16k yen then for 4\~4.5 hours of train compared to 1h of flight at 11.5k yen).

After arriving in Tokyo just before noon, I spent the rest of the day doing some shopping at Ginza ([Yamaha](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgDMm-VIc0pRnbFL8o0pXfPyivMGcIYrxXtnl5Hl6WTcIpxZFtXJ4rsJH9cyBej8mg4IuIHIITW6A-3HMTkwmvuxqIq4Sso8gVPBMDjsm_DrbO429QQkl4FcJwSbf0ZhiyLOJb0vr-J8uA0SO-Pt8gFXohc2_Ja6EJzKFvBtoAevZYExvsgscn8lt8NIcA/s4032/IMG_7221.JPG), Tokyu Hands, Itoya, etc), checking out [Tokyo Station ](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjAbcaW5iTbp5TCARqM__O4SLqXFUiYoPBnOa4fOF3TBYLtsKX2PFVmoYiUrZS6Of55vw5i_c0bz2Gx7krRH9bV0UjgUGv8_WPVsnMChBVZpoWMpv5uSbnZVZNghyb7Ag58rwIjdMbw5o-fFdzmXsjxUo53-kFeb2S1aGtrEiEtJTi7J8bLRQKZIQpcn_A/s4032/IMG_7100.JPG)and spent the remainder of my time at [Akihabara ](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjPc-8k3cyTwayBEsA-qhuCx4nX7ZbIg6B05rSKQEo6mZWUgf1_DXHTDSWdPyTlAFlOacUIKycNsJ2vwpUiG-LWd4iZOazrdUghOmPQbHg7aWA28TrNCyLemwkxpooe_xOCJbZzMn5EN0FJ2jruj3olZIg6wWne7KUaLxtx4JIgHI8JrwZOdFLqLx88uOE/s4032/IMG_7544.JPG)looking for good deals and some other [vtuber stuffs](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhDWWZgGfJoFgfgrW2Zcnswjq5wrmFGCMmbBvrmnM7sQjCI19Q_VtdT8y2tV1iRsWq8PfdqSkeaMBOBAdYGnZntbMUFoEeVnjXWH8pnb51jLaM3crqSoBiU8ko0LhbcmDQgYWAhgJATBEjeIENavgN0e7SHjxterAPJ0kCShH70yEegqQAbMhOoPdGagK4/s4032/IMG_7117.JPG). Your mileage may vary depending on interests (if you like shopping, you should cater for more time).

The final hotel for the next 5-6 days was the *Blossom Hibiya*, located near Shimbashi. Initially, I thought it was slightly out of the way compared to hotels at Ginza or Shinjuku, but as days went by I liked the venue more because it was more‚Ä¶ quieter and less hectic compared to those locations, with ample affordable dining options just a block away and JR/metro mere minutes walk away. The hotel [room ](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgZfN8I-qWWlua1KXfMbTKTKHh1GSN1cQYvBLu118EeR0Gpxf94T3RU7zmCTk-93192tH23ZVJOjz_E_A4mHrv505zSRsKKgcs68-y9DdMpW-_ZK3QsXR_ymQi6G5ibSxbNQ1Qm-U0Bw5E5Dq4iISr_ehDnQUKb61WDe7rS0bnh6QVO00h45it9k78u8Jw/s4032/IMG_7227.JPG)itself was not bad, with a pretty large comfortable bed, and a great view of the city (I could even see the Skytree from the hotel room!). Also comes with an iPad which allows you to control the room lighting and even check the washing machine availability. All in all, a pretty good but slightly expensive hotel - would recommend if you dont mind the hole in your wallet.

Thanks for reading. I‚Äôm honestly not sure if there is interest in my Tokyo/Chiba leg so this may be the last post (there‚Äôs plenty of Tokyo trip reports and they‚Äôre mainly of good quality so I'm not sure if my contribution is worth much). Hope you enjoyed reading it! In the event that I don't continue on the Tokyo/Chiba post, I would note that the all-in expenditure for the entire 36 days was approximately $13k USD (inclusive of a business flight ticket upgrade); with some cost optimization I believe the trip cost can go down to $10k USD.",https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1fgq0le/trip_report_36_days_across_western_japan_part_4/,"greate write up, thank you.

1fe63yc,First time in Japan - 10 (full) day solo itinerary,"Hi all, I'll be visiting Japan for the first time (solo from Australia) this October from Oct 10 - 21 and wanted to get some feedback/thoughts/suggestions based on what I have so far.

Ideally, I'd like to experience some of the known tourist spots, but wouldn't mind straying a little from the well trodden path to learn/immerse myself into Japanese history, culture, and sport.

Shinjuku, Harajuku and Shibuya is a lot. Expect to not be able to cram everything in this day.

Day 2- Senso-ji only takes a short time if you go early, so you should be able to get to the museum in the morning. You can also go to the Asakusa tourist information center, just across the street, which has a free observatory with good views of Senso-ji. 

If you're already going to Shibuya Sky, there's no need to spend money on the SkyTree, or any other observatory. Go to the free one in the Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building when you're in Shinjuku.

Day 10- Also a lot. Try to leave on the first shinkansen of the day to Hiroshima.

Have you checked the differences and pictures of the green cars? Because normal shinkansen seats are pretty premium as it is. You should treat yourself by spending that money in something else that you can only get in Japan, like a fancy dinner, an onsen or buying something for yourself.",[removed],"Maybe try to go to Yoyogi on a Sunday, so you can enjoy the flea market with a huge food court, enjoy the Japanese Rockabilly culture and just stroll around 
We didn‚Äôt do the skytree on top, but the mall underneath is very cool and Sumida next to kinshicho station is a very cool and quite neighbourhood with very nice ramen spots, we had some at Hokkaido Ramen Himuro.
Senso Ji is good very early or late, maybe even at night, just read that you can stroll there all time, we have been around 17:00 and it was completely full so we left pretty fast, being there you can get some nice souvenirs reasonably priced at the market in front of senso ji, just be careful with the prices 
I bought mine in a shop inside, bit more expensive but very good and beautiful quality, one had Christmas postcards which I bought a whole set so I will send out Japanese Christmas cards this year
Besides that we‚Äôve been at Teamlabs Planets and it was a very interesting and cool experience, we booked our tickets before, maybe consider it doing it as well
Shibuya crossing is cool on a Saturday evening if you are interested in cars, there will be quite a few on the street and they park there so you can enjoy some JDM culture for free , but it‚Äôs always packed üòÇ
We are leaving for Kyoto in one hour from Yokohama, so I can tell you more about Kyoto in a few days if interested
Just check the weather before going to Mt Fuji, our friend just went there a few days ago and he couldn‚Äôt see it because it was so cloudy, we will just pass it in two hours so let‚Äôs see
If going by Shinkansen to Kyoto book your seats for seat E,so you have a perfect view on Mt Fuji while riding the train",Maybe add an onsen in?,Day 1 Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building Observation Deck in Shinjuku. It is free. Also maybe consider the light show projected on the building itself from 7pm from 15min I think.

And, the Peace museum, park & dome will also take up ~5 hours if you aren‚Äôt rushing through it. I‚Äôd suggest spending 10/13 & 10/14 in Hiroshima - it‚Äôs a wonderful city with other sights like Shukkeien Garden, Orizuru tower, etc.; skipping Okayama on this trip; and spending the entire day on 10/15 in Himeji. Himeji castle & the adjoining Koko-en gardens alone will take up to ~6 hours to explore, and there‚Äôs also Engyo-ji & Omizosuji shopping street (if time & energy permit).",Do more in Hiroshima and less in Kyoto.

1ffxsl3,Retirees pivoting from cruise to 19 day land trip. Please help!,"We are a couple in our mid 60's. First time to Japan. Our typical international travel plans involve booking a cruise for 12 or 14 days, and adding on days in the embarkation and disembarkation ports to explore them. This trip started over a year ago with us booking a 12 day ""Best of Japan"" cruise for October 2024. We booked our own air and tacked on a full week ahead of the cruise to do some land-based sightseeing. Then the cruise line made several disagreeable changes to the cruise itinerary and we decided to bail on the cruise and pivot to doing a land trip based on our existing air reservations. We've never done such a long international land trip before. I'd appreciate any comments or suggestions. We especially enjoy history, museums, and exploring. We're open to new experiences but are not drinkers so not into bar scenes.  Please let me know what you think of our plans so far. And please make restaurant suggestions too. 

Also, we both have iPhone 14 Pluses. I know you can put a digital IC card on our phones. I saw in another thread that someone recommended using a physical card instead, apparently to conserve phone battery. Do you agree with this suggestion?

Your Day 14 is doable but a tight squeeze.","I don't have any specific advice but have you done similarly intensive itineraries elsewhere in the world? 

This seems very ambitious to me, you will need more downtime in my opinion. I don't think you need to concentrate so hard on checking all the tourist checkboxes, because wandering around casually and taking in the atmosphere can be equally as rewarding and more relaxing. It is an action-packed itinerary with many memorable sites but I feel like there needs to be more recuperation days, especially as you are at retirement age and risk exhaustion or injury.","Hi, your Tokyo days sound exhausting.  (I'm 60 and did a 19 day trip in April). Your 1st day, a 6 hour tour might be a bit much.  We did a 5 hour tour in Osaka and half of us were ready to crash.   Nikko is a really long day trip (I would allow 2 days for Nikko), Instead, how about Kamakura?  Or use that extra day for Nikko.  

 Also, day 14 Himeji & Hiroshima - I would rework the itinerary to do Himeiji-Miyajima Island (stay overnight in Miyajima and RELAX at a ryokan and use the onsen.  Miyajima was one of my favorite overnights), then the following day spend the day in Hiroshima.  Stay overnight in Hiroshima the train back to Tokyo.  By the end of the trip, you \*may\* want to spend more time in Tokyo.   I know I did, there's so much to see and do there.

Digital SUICA on our iPhone was so easy.  We carried our phone all the time anyways, it's 1 less thing to think about if it's already on your phone.  Make sure you carry a phone battery, you'll need that for sure.","You might want to move Fushimi Inari to Day 16 in the early morning and then continue on to Nara from there. It's logistically the better route, and leaves open more time to explore Philosopher's path after or on the way to Ginkakuji. Eikando is another great spot for foliage in that area.",

Especially because flights can throw curveballs at you, and you may not end up landing in Tokyo the time you planned. For example, a few weeks ago my flight to Japan was delayed and I ended up landing at midnight instead of 4pm. If something similar happened for you, the Shinkansen would be closed for the night and you‚Äôd need to pay exorbitant fares for a Taxi.",
1f8d3q3,Help with itinerary first time 14 nights November,"Hi everyone! Keeping the intro short; this will be me (31F) and my boyfriend's (31M) first time Japan in November for 14 nights. It's the typical golden route with some day trips included and I fully realize that it is a bit basic/mainstream, but I do want to go back in the future and go less mainstream at that point. My itinerary is mostly planned out but I feel myself hitting a little bit of a wall/needing advice. Main concerns are if it's a little too unplanned/formless on some days and maybe too packed on others, and if the way things are ordered make sense.

11/11 Monday - Tokyo. Land at Haneda airport 5:45 PM. Check in to hotel, grab food, check around the area, sleep at a reasonable time. Haven't booked a hotel yet, but looking at Ginza and Akasaka as potential areas based on my itinerary.

11/12 Tuesday - Tokyo. Go early to Tsukiji Market. Maybe grab some coffee, walk around Ginza and do some shopping, eat again at some point. Potentially eat at Chuka Soba Ginza Hachigou if I can get reservations. Depending on how we feel, maybe go to Shinjuku/Golden Gai/Omoide Yokocho for some nightlife or maybe Odaiba for chiller vibes/see the Small Worlds Museum. As you can see, this day isn't very fleshed out but I don't know if it's okay to just leave it like that...?

11/13 Wednesday - Tokyo. Shinjuku-Shibuya area. Probably do Shinjuku during the first half of the day (Shinjuku gyoen, shopping) and Shibuya the second half (like Shibuya Sky at sunset around 4:30PM). Thinking of doing yakiniku in this area for dinner. Maybe go back to Shinjuku for Golden Gai/Omide Yokocho if we didn't go the previous night? Do you guys prefer Shibuya or Shinjuku more at night? Would it be dumb to go back and forth (not more than once or twice)?  
- note to self: while we're at Shinjuku station, figure out where we need to go for the bus ride to Kawaguchiko

11/14 Thursday - Tokyo. Teamlab borderless in the morning. Check out surrounding area like Tokyo Tower/Shiba Park. Possibly check out the Daikanayama/Ebisu/Nakameguro neighborhoods for afternoon/evening. Considering the tempura omakase at Tempura Motoyoshi but it's kind of expensive; would appreciate if anyone who's tried it can give their experience.

11/15 Friday - Kawaguchiko. Forward luggage to Kyoto. Take highway bus from Shinjuku station to Shimoyoshida station. Go see Chureito Pagoda/Arakurayama Sengen Park. Take a local train to Kawaguchiko Station. Eat somewhere that serves hoto noodles (regional specialty). Rent a bike around the station and ride around Lake Kawaguchiko (and across the bridge) and go to Oishi Park. Things to see on the way if there is time: Maple Corridor, Kubota Itchiku Art Museum, Music Forest Museum. I would like to head to our ryokan (Konansou) by 4-5PM and enjoy the rest of the day there. Looking forward to the in-room onsen and kaiseki dinner! 

11/16 Saturday - Kawaguchiko to Kyoto. Eat breakfast early at the ryokan. Possibly go to the Fuji Panoramic Ropeway when it opens at 8:30AM and check out the park at the top. Might need to plan for a 40-min hike down if the cable car lines are long. Check out from ryokan and go to Kawaguchiko Station. Go on to Mishima Station to then transfer to shinkansen to Kyoto. Do you think I'd need to allow for a 1 hour layover between transfers to account for any possible delays, offboarding/onboarding? Or is 30-40 minutes about enough?

Once in Kyoto, check in to hotel and explore the area, get something to eat around Nishiki market/Gion. Possibly check out Kodaiji temple night illumination. Entoku-in is nearby and also has a night illumination; would that be worth going to also or too redundant?

11/17 Sunday - Kyoto. Go to Arashiyama early in the morning. Lunch at Shigetsu (or possibly Yudofu Sagano). Take the Sagano Romantic Train ride and take the boat back on the Hozugawa River. I'm not sure how long we'd stay at the bamboo forest itself or how much time will be in between things, but I have Otagi Nenbutsu-ji (would probably taxi there) and the monkey park as possibilities if there's time. Before leaving, I'd like to see Kimono Forest lit up at night, have dinner, and possibly check out the footbath at Arashiyama station before taking the Keifuku Randen tram back to the hotel.

11/18 Monday - Kyoto. Go to Fushimi Inarii early in the morning. Depending on energy, either go straight back down or take a trail toward Tofuku-ji. No other plans solidified for this day, but maybe we can do a kimono rental/tea ceremony, see Kiyomizu-dera at sunset and walk through Sannenzaka/Ninenzaka. Go (back) to Nishiki Market/Gion for food at some point?

11/19 Tuesday - Kyoto. Day trip to Nara, typical tourist spots like seeing the deer, mochi making, Todaiji. Try some regional foods and shop for regional specialties. Go back to Kyoto at some point. Nothing else planned but maybe check out Philosopher's Path or one of the following:

* Kinkakuji
* Kyoto Imperial Palace
* Nijojo
* Other?

In general I feel like my Kyoto days are a little unstructured, and some places are somewhat far apart. I am worried but also not lol. Anyone else feel this way about things? I figure if we find ourself with a lot of time, we could just decide in real time where to go or just rest up.

11/20 Wednesday- Kinosaki Onsen. Forward luggage to Osaka. Take train to Kinosaki Onsen station. Buy the Kinosaki Must-Visit pass. Grab food, check out the shops, hit up Kiyamachi square. Go to the Ropeway and take the tram. Stop by Osenji Shrine and Museum of Art at the midpoint then continue to the cafe at the summit. Check in at ryokan around 3PM. Check out some of the public onsen and get back to ryokan in time for dinner 6-6:30PM. Walk around more/do whatever. I know going to this city might be a weird detour, but we really wanted to try the local red matsuba crab specialty that's in season during this time. We looove crab!

11/21 Thursday - Kinosaki Onsen to Osaka. Breakfast at ryokan. Rent a bike to go toward the shore/Tsuiyama and/or bike to Genbudo Park. If there's time, clean up and relax at the onsen near the station and buy some food/more souvenirs. Plan to arrive in Osaka a little later in the evening (8PM would be the absolute latest arrival in Osaka for the train). May have time to check out Dotombori or just the area around the hotel.

11/22 Friday - Osaka. Universal Studios day. Plan to buy the express pass and also get there early. A little worried about crowds since it seems like the next day 11/23 is a holiday, Labor Thanksgiving Day.

11/23 Saturday - Osaka. Possibly get the Osaka Amazing pass. Possibly check out Osaka Castle (is the boat ride around the castle worth doing?), Kuromon market/Dotonbori, do a cruise on the river in the evening (is Tombori River cruise or Osaka Wonder Cruise better?). Also interested in Kaiyukan Aquarium and the nearby ferris wheel, but not sure if there will be enough time and if it would be way too crowded (this would be in the evening). Also, is Umeda Sky better during the daytime or at night? Not sure if it's worth doing a final luggage forward to Tokyo?

11/24 Sunday - Tokyo. Probably just head straight to Tokyo via Shinkansen. Check in to hotel. Maybe check out Ueno park or just do whatever, shop some more. Maybe have a nice sushi omakase for our last dinner before leaving. Maybe end up in Akihabara for the evening, check out the arcades. Heard that the streets will be closed for pedestrians on Sundays so that should be nice. Haven't booked a hotel but thinking of staying around the Asakusa area.

11/24 Monday - Flight back home at 6:25 PM. Go to Sensoji early in the morning, and walk around Asakusa area (Nakamise Dori, Kappabashi Dogugai). Whatever we can squeeze in before eating lunch and heading to Haneda airport by 3PMish or earlier. 

  
Sorry this ended up being kind of long. I guess I'm mainly struggling to see if I have an okay level of preparedness as it feels like I'm getting to the point that if I do too much research, I'm going to start overloading things. I'm not trying to be too overwhelmed, but some advice would be truly appreciated! Also, not asking for any specific recommendations but always open to hearing them! Thanks in advance to anyone who takes the time to read or respond!!",https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1f8d3q3/help_with_itinerary_first_time_14_nights_november/,"Nothing wrong with doing the mainstream stuff since neither of you have been there before.

As far as your worry that its too packed on some days and formless on others, I would say that's a good thing.

The days you don't have as much planned will come as a blessing imo. I always find there's a few days in my trip that I end up just heading back to my hotel for a nap.

Or if you aren't tired, those moments are where you wander off the beaten path and stumble upon hidden gems.

In Kyoto, I'd definitely recommend steering away from the main tourist areas. I rented bicycles with my mates on our first trip and we ended up getting lost. Those memories of the sun setting and being on bikes arguing about which direction we were supposed to be going with my friends are a core memory for all of us and we would have never experienced it if we stayed near the touristy areas","Might be better for you to do Nara on the day you going to Fushimi since it is on the way, 

On the other day you could do Kinkakuji 1st thing in the morning, go back to Nishiki Market for an early lunch, rent kimono before heading over to Higashiyama area for the remaining of the day.","Re: illuminations I recommend seeing as many as you can. They're all a really beautiful way to see temples when you normally can't. Osaka castle may also be doing winter illuminations when you arrive which I highly recommend. Really cute and fun for pictures!

Kyoto is also not that hard to get around tbh, we saw on average at least 5 temples a day and we were going from Gion.","I think this is a really good approach especially if you plan to go back for another visit. My husband and I have been twice and our second trip we focused on 1-2 ‚Äúmust do‚Äù activities per day (whether that was a restaurant, temple, etc) and then went with the flow for the remainder. This allowed us to really take our time in the places we enjoyed, stumble upon things, revisit and take recommendations from locals. Some of our favorite restaurants were suggested by the food and bev manager at our Kyoto hotel. 

Kinosaki onsen is out of the way but so so worth it. It‚Äôs just the cutest town and we really enjoyed our time there this past spring. Some of the shops and restaurants have odd hours so be prepared for that. There‚Äôs a great little micro brewery that has beer, incredible pizza, curry etc that seemed to be open more than some of the other places. Also usually 2 of the public bath houses are closed each day, so check their hours. And the train station in kinosaki onsen is tiny with somewhat infrequent trains so plan accordingly. There is an adorable cafe right beside the train station in kinosaki onsen called grandmas pumpkin cafe (or something to that effect) that has great desserts and coffee if you need to kill time.",I'm traveling there 11/13 - 11/28 lol

At Hakone-Yumoto station there is a luggage delivery service that can send your luggage straight to your ryokan or hotel. 

This way you can explore Hakone right away upon arrival without needing to go check-in at your accommodation first, giving you way more time for sightseeing. 

But the luggage delivery service closes at 12:30 so try to get there earlier for this.",Dang. We almost have the same schedule and almost the same dates!,can i ask which ryokan you booked for hakone? im also going soon!,"One day in Hakone? That's too bad. There's a great amount of things to do here in Hakone. If you get the chance, visit the Amazake Tea House. It's really cool! The bus stop is right in front.

Everything closes here very early (around 5-6 pm). If you eat out, be sure to do so before the restaurants close. Also, Gora doesn't have many konbinis. You'll want to grab some snacks in Yumoto if you get the chance.

Day 9 you can easily add Asakusa or Ginza, as both are relatively close in either direction from Akihabara. Asakusa is of course known for Senso-iji, Steakhouse Sukizuki is highly recommended, and the famous kitchen tools street is there as well. Alternatively, Ginza is like the Beverly Hills of Tokyo(it‚Äôs fancy with a lot of high end shopping). There are great cocktail bars if y‚Äôall drink, otherwise I‚Äôd really only suggest you go if you‚Äôre just generally curious as you really can shop all the same brands in Shibuya/Harajuku.

For Day 10, besides the the Gundam, is there anything specific at Diver City you‚Äôre interested in? As, you have Ikebukuro Sunshine City on your list, which I feel will satisfy all the same boxes that Diver City will, and beyond.

Day 11, I cannot stress enough getting to Sunshine City right when most of the stores open(which is around 10am I believe). The stores can become absurdly packed/busy, so the earlier you get there, the better chance you have at having a comfortable shopping experience. Highly recommend Sesame Street Market.

Day 12- Shibuya and Harajuku are so absolutely dense with activities that I truly feel you can allocate tow days alone to exploring them. Whatever you do, please stop at Iyoshi Cola. It‚Äôs a really good way to wind down for a second, and the Cola will make you feel great.

Do you have any interest in Tokyo Disney? I noticed you have USJ. Tokyo DisneySea is regarded as one of the best theme parks in the world, so perhaps one of your lighter days can be reworked to incorporate it?

Generally speaking, as your trip approaches, check online for any themed cafes or pop ups. Shibuya‚Äôs Miyashita Park had a Spongebob Cafe and a Hello Kitty Bruno Mars popup that I had no idea about- I just stumbled upon them. Not saying either of these will appeal to you necessarily, but Tokyo alone has so many darn collabs/pop-up all year round, it may be wise to be on the lookout for any that might appeal to you :)

Lastly, if you have time for it, check out Shimokitazawa. Osaka is one of my favorite cities in Japan, and Shimokitazawa really made me feel like I was back there. Highly recommend Mothers, the sister establishment Mothers Ruin, and Magic Spice. This is a neighborhood you can just hop off the train with no plan and really let the night sweep you away.",You‚Äôre arriving and leaving the same days as us.

**Day 1 - Tokyo**  
  
Land at Haneda around 8 PM. Expecting it will be 10 PM by the time we check into our hotel so thinking of grabbing food from 7-11 and calling it a night. Staying in Shinjuku.

* Eat Hiroshima okonomiyaki 
* Travel to Osaka on day 5

  
**Day 6 & 7 - Osaka**

Edit - these are the activities that caught my eye but we definitely can‚Äôt do it all so we will look to prioritise maybe 4 things.

* Some of these - Nara deer park, Osaka Castle, Dotonbori, Kuromon Ichiba Market, Shin Sekai ""New World"", Cup noodles museum, Todai-ji, Super Nintendo World Japan, Universal Studios
* We have been to Universal Studios in other cities so not sure we will prioritise this - although the nintendo world is one we'd like to go for.

1fgzb4r,"Should I keep a ""free day"" or allocate an extra day to Kyoto? ","Long story short, I've allocated two full ""free days"" in Tokyo at the end of my two week trip for shopping, random exploration, etc. However, I'm considering shelving one of these days and reallocating it to another day in Kyoto (currently at 2.5-3 days there).

My Kyoto itinerary covers most of what I want to see already, but adding an extra day would let me slow things down, perhaps give me a chance to visit Kinkaku-ji (excluded due to time constraints) or give me a chance for another day trip to some place like Uji. At the same time, I'm told half of the fun in Japan is spontaneously exploring and I'd hate to lose out on a day of that. I'd love to just get lost in a Tokyo neighborhood or relax with a cup of coffee, etc.

My outline for the Kyoto leg of the trip was:

**Kyoto Day 1**  
  
Early train to Kyoto, either from Hakone or Tokyo  
Check into hotel  
Kyoto Imperial Palace  
Nijo Castle (either this or Imperial Palace, likely no time for both)  
Nishiki Market (check open/close times)  
Daimaru department store basement? (tea etc)  
Kyoto Station - giant mall/train station/hotel  
Gion area in evening

**Kyoto Day 2**

Early morning, start at Kiyomizu-dera  
Higashiyama district  
Maruyama Park  
Chionin Temple  
Philosopher's Path/Ginkaku-ji in afternoon  
Dinner 

Fushimi Inari in evening

**Kyoto Day 3**

Otagi Nenbutsuji  
Arashiyama Proper - explore areas like Saga Toriimoto Street and Gioji Moss Garden  
Arashiyama Park - Walk through bamboo groves  
Okochi Sanso Villa  
lunch  
Nintendo museum in Uji - no time to explore area else as shops close \~4pm  
Gion, dinner in area

Fushimi Inari in the evening if not done yesterday

**Kyoto Day 4 (Nara Day Trip)**  
Day trip to Nara  
If time after Nara, go to Uji

Does anyone have any thoughts? This would be my first time in Japan so I'm not sure if an extra day in Kyoto is worth it. The extra leeway might be nice but there's a part of me that doesn't want to give up a day of spontaneous Tokyo exploration. Thank you for your input!",https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1fgzb4r/should_i_keep_a_free_day_or_allocate_an_extra_day/," Personally I would put an extra day in Kyoto for a full day trip to Uji. Makes no sense for me to cut Uji into 2 trips on different days. Also because I prefer seeing non-cities. One free day in Tokyo is more than enough for me to go shopping for omiyage. 

If you decide to add another Kyoto day, Kyoto Day 2 - Kinkakuji in the afternoon after Arashiyama then the Extra Kyoto day in Uji.

Kyoto Day 4 - move Fushimi Inari to very early morning here of you‚Äôre just going to climb a little bit to snap a few photos.  It‚Äôs on the JR Nara Line. For Nara, I usually recommend taking the bus to Kasuga Taisha then make your way down back to the station passing by Todaiji, a few gardens, and Nara Park (Get a sightseeing map at Nara station). If you end up a bit short on time to go to Uji, I recommend exploring Naramachi instead.","Save the free day for Tokyo. I have been to Kyoto ten years apart, most recently this year. I would say that if you've never been before it's worth going, but the city itself is quite grim and once you've seen the attractions (which are now overrun with tourists doing the same) there's not a lot to recommend spending time there over exploring more of Tokyo.

Tldr: the extra time in Tokyo is in my view more valuable",I just got back a week ago and 3 days in Kyoto is more than enough. It was Tokyo where I felt I could have used more time even after a week,"If you fancy omakase btw, go to Sushi Ovino.

Any tips on where we can leave luggage just in case we can't check in on time or if we check out early?",https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1fgm8xv/nagoya_to_osakanarakyoto/,"Not really doable imo. I also don't think it's worth going to places just to take a photo and move on.

I would do two nights in Kyoto and one night in Osaka. Then choose fewer places to visit and do them properly. Leave Nara for next time.","Wow, that‚Äôs really ambitious. If you would like to rush from A to B and visit all the ‚ÄûInstagram spots‚Äú: (as it looks like): Do it. Otherwise, I would suggest you to rethink your plans‚Ä¶ Please keep in mind that there may be waiting times e.g. at Starbucks and that there will be lots of tourists at the sights you selected.","If your plan is all staying at hotel in Osaka, and visit Nara and Kyoto from Osaka, no problem.

If you plan day 1 hotel in Nara, you can go directly from Nagoya to Nara via Kintetsu line.  It is much easier to ride, but it is not JR line, so if you have JR free ticket, use of JR would be cheaper.","Day 1. why travel to osaka from nagoya? you can travel from nagoya-kyoto-nara. 

whole day in nara is ok. 

Day 2. all doable. if you'll go early.  

for osaka castle to make it easier use this [https://www.osakacastlepark.jp/articles/detail.html?lang=en&id=154](https://www.osakacastlepark.jp/articles/detail.html?lang=en&id=154)

Day 3. too much. i would drop either fushimi inari or arashiyama bamboo grove. 

you can do this. go early before the starbucks coffee opens take a taxi that will take you to the alley entrance of ninenzaka where the starbucks is located. 

then walk ninenzaka and sanenzaka you can also visit kiyomizu-dera while you're there. 

then you can also just walk up to yakasa pagoda. then later do to fushimi inari. 

i suggested to drop either fushimi inari or bamboo forest due to they're on the opposite side of kyoto.",

Fushimi Inari could be tagged onto the Nara Day since it‚Äôs along the way from Kyoto. You‚Äôd hop on the JR Nara Line afterwards, or use Keihan to Kintetsu to get to Nara from Fushimi.

1fdl845,Revised Itinerary Based on Feedback - First Time Visitors to Japan October 2024,"Hi all, really appreciate all the great feedback received on my [last post](https://old.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1fb83mp/first_time_travelers_to_japan_october_2024/?cache-bust=1725982101025). As the general consensus was that there were too many things on each day, I've tried to further narrow it down based on logistics / proximity. In any case, this will serve as mostly a guide, and we can of course switch things up as we see fit when on the ground (to account for energy levels, weather, etc.).

We are staying right near Tokyo Central in our first few days, and staying at the JR Kyushu Hotel Blossom Shinjuku when we come back to Tokyo at the end of our trip.

A few additional questions:

* We of course want to experience good food, but the amount of choice is overwhelming and we don't have strong feelings about going to prestigious places. Should we just wing everything? Or is it better to book in advance on tabelog?
* Should we book shinkansen tickets in advance (e.g. SmartEX), or only once on the ground?
* It's hard to book tickets in advance for things like TeamLabs without knowing how we will feel that day, whether or not we can figure out the transit in time, etc. Is it better to book in advance and hope for the best, or wing it on the ground?

The cost for a pass is much too high now, so you will be traveling ad hoc, and can buy a ticket on the day of travel for the best flexibility. If you are not traveling on holidays or during morning or evening busy times, then you shouldn't have problems getting a seat on the train, or if you'd like a reservation. The ticket offices can be crowded but the machines are less so.","Don‚Äôt worry about food or reservations. Even the hole-in-the-wall joint has better food than 90% of the restaurants in North America. Food is plentiful. If you can‚Äôt find anything, just go to the restaurant floor of any large department store and take your pick.

However, a lot of restaurants close early. Like, rolling down the shutter at 8 pm. So don‚Äôt dilly dally. Unless you‚Äôre in a huge centre. And if everything is closed, go to the station. There‚Äôs bound to be an izakaya or at least a ramen joint open later in that area.","For restaurants, just wing it.

Highly overrated IMO. Was there last week. 
They had just a few installations that were mediocre at best. They had 2 water related installations and it was like wading through Chlorine the whole time that i wanted to puke. And then right after they had a fower light project which felt like someone was spraying a can of air freshener in ur face every 30secs. Gave me such a bad head that i just wanted to lie down. Im not allergic to anything.. but this was such a disappointment",Also this itinerary looks very exhausting to do..let alone to even read it. I don‚Äôt know how old you guys are but it looks as though you‚Äôre starting out early in the morning and then finishing up late every single freaking day. You are underestimating the time it takes for you to figure the transit system and how much time it will take for you to make those connections. The amount of walking time and time and energy levels in the heat. And the sheer amount of crowds that‚Äôs here in Japan at all these popular places. Every single place is packed.

better start from yoyogi in the morning and makes your way up to Shibuya scramble

Day 10

start from Ueno and make your way to Akihabara, Ameyoko have many food stalls and restaurant so good place for breakfast

Day 11

Too packed, choose either you go to toyosu or tsukiji and ginza or Kawasaki Costco (imo looking at the map it's a one hour train not really worth it unless you have specific goals why you want to go there)",My wife and I kind of wished we would have stayed 2 nights in Kinosaki. I personally think one less night in Tokyo or even Osaka for that. Personally didn't care for Osaka too much.,"How about instead of going from Kinosaki to Tokyo for a min 5 hr train ride in one day, you stay in Kinosaki longer on your 2nd day (like late afternoon) and then take the train down to Himeji to see the castle and possibly night illumination depending on when you‚Äôre going? Plenty of pretty good izakayas in Himeji too or after seeing the castle you can go out to Kobe/Sannomiya for a little more of a lively night life.","I always wonder when people have ""shopping"" in the middle of the day and then go somewhere else in the evening, where do they store what they buy or are they expecting to carry their things around?

This is especially eerie when people have specific items to buy and a big list, and they just kind of fit that in the middle of the day away from hotel and also make evening plans to some fancy restaurants or activities.... Like... Does it even make sense in your home country???

Going to Costco and then to Ginza... Hmmm just strange for me but hey perhaps you don't mind carrying groceries with you, or you just go to Costco to browse and don't expect to buy anything.",
1fhtjg3,15 Day Itinerary Check - First time - Mostly Tokyo ,"Hello! My two friends and I are heading to Japan next week and I wanted to float our itinerary out here to see if anyone had any notes! We were lucky enough to get reservations for almost all the things that we wanted to see.

This is our first trip to Japan and the girls are mostly excited about clothes, beautiful sights, food, parks, and anime merch. We want to bring back a ton of souvenirs and experience as many cool things as we can while also not dying.

**Day 15**

* Flight home
* Tears of sadness

I'm also worried about a few things in particular:

1. Weather. Our friends that just came back from Japan warned us that it's a LOT of walking, so I tried not to overbook us on any day. I want to leave some wiggle room so we can do whatever we feel like or take a break if we need it. Unfortunately according to the 10 day forecasts, it looks like its going to start raining the moment we get there, and *literally never end*. We're pretty bummed about that, but we're trying to be positive! I'd rather be soggy in Japan than dry and at work.
2. On the other hand, are we making a mistake by barely leaving Tokyo? I wasn't confident that I'd be able to navigate the trains/buses/taxis so I was worried about going too far. It does suck to miss out on places like Osaka and Kyoto but the hope is that someday we'll be able to go back to Japan and be more comfortable exploring an even bigger radius. In hindsight, it feels like we've prioritized loot over sight seeing haha.
3. Gluten free food. My one friend has celiac and cannot eat anything with wheat (which also includes soy sauce). She's printed out a card that we can show to staff to warn them of her allergy and I've marked off a handful of places that apparently have GF options, but not enough for 2 meals over 15 days. I guess we'll probably need to find some konbini food that she can eat and just be stocked up with snacks at all times.

Any notes or feedback would be much appreciated (about those things, or the trip in general)! We're all a little nervous.",https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1fhtjg3/15_day_itinerary_check_first_time_mostly_tokyo/,"Please do not visit the hedgehog caf√© or any other animal attraction. Hedgehogs are shy, nocturnal animals that should not be pawed at during the daytime by myriad human hands. They also are not native to Japan and have nothing to do with the country except highlighting how lax and poorly enforced animal cruelty laws are in Japan. Why are there no hedgehog caf√©s in England? Because the owners would be imprisoned.

As for spending most of your time in Tokyo, it'll not be a mistake. I've been here for more than 35 years and still have things on my to-visit list.

It likely will not rain all of the time you're here. Today the little icon in the weather applications I saw showed rain, but it rained for less than an hour between 10 and 11 AM only. What you're seeing is chances of rain.",">Day 6  

You might want to check out [the Harajuku main store](https://maps.app.goo.gl/MSST94Ct5c32iTqD7) and [the 1.3.5 store](https://maps.app.goo.gl/dHW1cEpw6pcuynbt5) of WEGO. The Whinny line might be to your taste.
 
>Day 8  
Shinkansen to Zao Fox Village (if we can get train tickets the night before)

There is only one bus from Shiraishi-Za≈ç Station, which departs at 10:10 AM. If you miss this bus, you will need to take a taxi, so please be aware.  

>Day 9  
Uniqlo Ginza Flagship Store

There are two flagship Uniqlo stores in Ginza: [Uniqlo Ginza](https://maps.app.goo.gl/vrPANoHsdQZVbpjF7) and [Uniqlo Tokyo](https://maps.app.goo.gl/WqdzFjXnNYLsiaRi8). I recommend visiting Uniqlo Tokyo for convenience. This is because [GU](https://maps.app.goo.gl/JrVvR1bpXzGDLDDA8) and [Daiso](https://maps.app.goo.gl/2UdULaKRN5yRDMUGA) are also in the same building, and stores like [LOFT](https://maps.app.goo.gl/3hnLyM74cJ87wyhU6), [Muji](https://maps.app.goo.gl/zGkbnA6pbiAVh4yUA), [ABC Mart](https://maps.app.goo.gl/bFyseqqKBJW2nDg29), [Hands](https://maps.app.goo.gl/A9UR6hKYNwqgz1iD8), and [Itoya](https://maps.app.goo.gl/JEKwCwJEfkT7bEmA9) are closer to this location.",Pok√©mon Center is on the itinerary 3 times?,"Don't worry about the rain. Rain icons don't mean ""downpour"", it'll probably be a mix of rain, drizzle, and no-rain. I even see some sun on the forecast, so I'm sure you'll get a little. On my last trip, I was in Kagoshima for 3 days. It was rain, rain, fog. I enjoyed the city just fine, and was only salty that I never saw Sakura-jima (the volcano island across the bay). Rain won't stop you from shopping, eating, visiting temples and sights.. And it actually can make for some really cool noir-esque photo opportunities, too. Neon city lights look amazing (very cyberpunk) in the rain and fog. You probably won't glimpse Fuji in the distance, but even on a good day it's barely more than a silhouette when viewed from Tokyo.

Do any of you carry iPhones? If you do, you can add digital Suica cards to your wallet. These are a lot more convenient than the physical cards. You can wave your phone over the readers at the stations, same as a physical card. However, the refilling is the best: you can just tap a button and add cash straight from your phone (provided you have internet). This beats standing in the lines to add cash at the machines. Any iPhone should be able to do it. Why not Android? I mean, it does exist. But for some reason, the feature is region (or country?) locked on Android. Only Japanese Android phones get it.

While Jet Lag is definitely a thing, it sounds like you are staying in the Asakusa area. Senso-ji is in Asakusa. So you can probably walk around that whole area during your recovery days. Unless there's some specific activity you want to do, ""experiencing senso-ji"" usually consists of walking around the grounds, walking down nakamise-dori (possibly shopping), getting a snack.. Possibly praying and obtaining the goshuin stamps from the temple. If you are staying that area, the closest places to eat and scope out the immediate area will likely have a big overlap with these main senso-ji areas. You may discover yourself walking past senso-ji as you walk to some dinner place. Of course, if you have designs on renting kimono, then setting aside a whole day for that + pictures is probably a good idea.

Someone mentioned the wild animal cafes, I would agree to not give them business. I draw the line at cat cafes, since they are  domesticated. If they weren't in a cafe, they'd likely be in some other human dwelling (as opposed to roaming the kitty wilds).

I also agree with skipping Nara--provided you're sticking to Tokyo. Nara is right next to Kyoto. If you're going to Shinkansen to Nara, you might as well integrate Kyoto into your trip. While Kyoto is most famous for its temples and scenery, it is still a big city with big city things. For example, if I were going to both, I'd probably plan to go to the Nintendo store in Kyoto, rather than Tokyo. It's newer (I've read better), and Kyoto is Nintendo's home city. Many of your Tokyo shopping plans can be executed in either Tokyo or Kyoto. 

If Nara is a priority, I'd add Kyoto days to your trip, at least a few days. On my first trip (also 2 weeks), I did a week in each and it felt right. But if you expect to be back someday, it's more than fine to do deeper dive in Tokyo (Tokyo can handle it!) and then maybe on your next trip, you can wholly skip Tokyo and go to Kyoto/Osaka (and include Nara).","Tears of relief is a vibe, gonna add it to my itinerary too üòå"
1fe8thz,First time traveler - 14 days itinerary feasibility check,"Good morning, afternoon or night good people on this sub. I'm planning on going to Japan for the very first time in the autumn of 2025. It's been a dream for many, many years to go and I'm finally able to go next year - although only for 14 days max due to obligations.

I will be traveling with four other people who have visited Japan earlier this year, but didn't really have a proper plan and mostly visited Tokyo and Kyoto. We care for seeing and experiencing culture the most, and would like a good mix of modern city, traditional and nature. I've done some research and thought up the following itinerary, which obviously is extremely optimistic, tight and tough and the reason why I come here to ask for help. I've used the website Rome2Rio to calculate approximate travel times between destinations.

**Day 1 - Tokyo** *(1st accomodation)*

* Arrive in Tokyo.
* We don't know what time we will arrive, so depending on that we will simply get acclimatized and experience jetlag, stroll around for food and drinks. If there's time enough we'd like to visit Akihabara.

**Day 2 - Tokyo**  *(1st accomodation)*

* Tokyo Sky Tree.
* Stroll around Asakusa and visit Senso-ji.
* Stroll around Shibuya during the rest of the day.
* Stroll around Shinjuku at night.

**Day 3 - Shibu Onsen** *(2nd accomodation)*

* Travel to Yudanaka *(\~3h 20m)*
* Explore and make use of the hot springs at Shibu Onsen.

**Day 4 - Shibu Onsen & Kanazawa** *(3rd accomodation)*

* Visit Snow Monkey Park at Jigokudani in the morning.
* Make our way back to Yudanaka and travel to Kanazawa *(\~2h 38m)*.
* Use remaining time to stroll around Kanazawa for food and drinks, and to relax.

**Day 5 - Kanazawa**  *(3rd accomodation)*

* Kenrokuen, Seisonkaku Villa, Ninjadara, Higashi Chaya district, Kanazawa castle.
* Pretty much anything else we can fit into this day, there's a lot we find interesting here.

**Day 6 - Shirakawa & Takayama** *(4th accomodation)*

* Travel to Shirakawago by bus in the morning *(\~1h 25m)*.
* Explore Shirakawago during the afternoon.
* Travel to Takayama by bus *(\~1h 5m)*.
* Stroll around for food and drinks, and to relax.

**Day 7 - Takayama** *(4th accomodation)*

* Visit the Old Town in Takayama.
* We generally want to wander around and relax in Takayama and take in the atmosphere.

**Day 8 - Nakasendo Trail** *(5th accomodation)*

* Travel to Magomejuku in the early morning, as early as possible *(\~4h 47min)*.
* Hike to Tsumagojuku *(\~3-4h)*.
* Explore Tsumago for the remaining evening and relax from this likely tough but beautiful day.

**Day 9 - Kyoto** *(6th accomodation)*

* Travel to Kyoto in the morning *(\~3h 1m*).
* Visit Gion and the Heian shrine.
* Gyoen National Garden.
* Use rest of day to relax and stroll around our for food and drinks.

**Day 10 - Kyoto** *(6th accomodation)*

* Arashiyama in the morning.
* Kinkaku-ji > Kiyomizu > Fushimini Inari during the rest of the day.

**Day 11 - Kyoto & Osaka** *(6th accomodation)*

* Day trip to Osaka *(\~12m)*
* Osaka Castle.
* Shinsekai.
* Go back to Kyoto and simply relax, stroll around for food and drinks.

**Day 12 - Kyoto & Tokyo** *(7th accomodation)*

* Visit all the temples and shrines we can fit into the morning.
* Travel to Tokyo in the afternoon *(\~2h 18m)*.
* Strolling around, relaxing.

**Day 13 - Tokyo** *(7th accomodation)*

* We're honestly just looking to explore as many as possible tiny streets on this day, visit as many hidden gems and food places we can find.
* Depending on flight times, stroll around for the last time, buy last minute souvenirs.

**Day 14 - Tokyo**

* Depending on flight times, stroll around for the last time, buy last minute souvenirs.
* Fly back home.

I would love to hear the thoughts of experienced travelers on what to skip, swap or do differently on this itinerary. Many thanks for the read and the help!

PS: My first post got deleted for being bare-bones. I understand it might still be somewhat vague and barebones, but I'm planning this trip for one year from now and am just looking for confirmation on feasibility, and if not feasible on what I could do to make it more feasible.",https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1fe8thz/first_time_traveler_14_days_itinerary_feasibility/,My impression is that you're moving around much too much. Seven hotel changes is going to eat a very substantial portion of your waking hours.,"Too many hotel/room changes as others have said. 

Also, jet lag can be torturous on occasion and any plans for the first couple of days may need to be changed/reviewed. 

I wouldn‚Äôt plan on doing anything substantial (outside of walking and exploring) until your second or third full day. 

You can totally push through that stuff but in my experience it can compromise the enjoyment of the activities.","Day 10 in kyoto is physically impossible.

Day 2, try to just do sensoji and akihabara.

Also keep in mind everything opens up at 10am, and closes at 8pm in tokyo. You can fit 2 places comfortabally, and 3 max which might be pushing it but still doable.

and like others have said, you are going from place to places waaaaay too much.","It's too much in 14 days, maximum 3-4 places. You will be so k.o. especially after traveling. And if your friends have already been in Tokyo and Kyoto, why not stay longer in Osaka?",
1fibx7o,Itinerary check,"Hi everyone, 

I am planning my first trip to Tokyo, Japan. I felt like I wanted to see so many things in a short period. I wondered if anyone could point up where to go in my 5-day itinerary. I am staying with my friend near the Itabashi area. I wanted to explore both Akihabara, Ginza, and Mt. Fuji tour but not sure if it's possible with my time. I am also open to stay a couple nights in different areas.

23/10 
Arrive at NRT @ 12.30 PM >> Go to my friend's place to drop off luggage (3 pm estimated). Thinking of getting my luggage shipped from the airport as well so that I can stroll around  right away instead of putting my luggage in my friend's place
Stroll around Shibuya, and Shinjuku (see how far I can explore, if tired go home). 

24/10 
Meiji Shrine, Harajuku, Shimokitazawa,

25/10 
Tsujiki Mark,¬†TeamLab, Tokyo Tower, and Imperial Palace. Not sure where I need to explore (Akihabara or Ginza)

27/10
any recommendation?",https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1fibx7o/itinerary_check/,"Hm, your itinerary feels a bit like jumping from A to B. Better find sights that are closer together. 

I would do it like this:

D1: Ueno, Asakusa/Senso-ji and maybe Kappabashi dori, Skytree, Solamachi
D2: Teamlab @Mori Art Museum, Tokyo Tower, Hamarikyu, Ginza (not a must for me) 
D3: Yoyogi-Park, Harajuku, Omotesando, Shibuya
D4: Disney Sea
D5: Ikebukuro, Sunshine City, Aquarium, Sunshine 60
Departure day (if you have time in Narita): Narita Aeon Mall and area (there is Uniqlo and Donki) is good to go shopping. 

Imperial palace is not really a must go imho. 
D5 is good for shopping ;-)

I would suggest you to use luggage forwarding in order not lot lose time. 5 days is really short.","Try and cluster things together geographically to minimise the back and forth in transit

And to avoid having to ship luggage, why not just take carry on only for 5 days? Pack a lightweight duffel inside your carry on if you plan to do shopping (they're also available from donki for about 4000JPY)","Just stick to one or two neighbourhoods and don't try to do too much public transportation moving around the city, you will eat up all your time traveling.","I'd consider cutting the Imperial Palace since you have such a short amount of time in the city and it really isn't worth it imo, you don't get to see much of the palace as a lot of it is restricted from the public and it's absolutely packed with tourists. It's hard to recommend things without knowing what exactly you're interested in but for your free day Asakusa might be worth a visit, I loved going around Senso-ji Temple early in the morning when there weren't many people around. It's also not too far from Akihabara (about 20 mins on the train) so you could go there on the same day.",

Some of those places look a little far from the central city. The buses are quite good in Fukuoka so you'll be fine in public transport if you choose but renting a car and driving around is much easier.

Food in Fukuoka is amazing by the way. I ate like 4 meals a day when I was there last month because everything was so delicious. I highly recommend eating Motsunabe while you're there - it's a regional specialty hotpot dish with pork offal and is delicious! Also everybody raves about Hakata ramen but I found so many places that did handmade udon that was NEXT LEVEL üòç

I‚Äôve done a lot of research, but want to know what I‚Äôm missing out on with our current itinerary. We also want to leave time to explore, find new places to visit, and not be too crazy busy. That said, I‚Äôm keeping a lot of free time in our itineraries. 

We love Japanese food and sake and are excited to take in the culture. We aren‚Äôt planning to book dinners in advance, we intend to see what catches our eye instead. We‚Äôre both interested in seeing historic sites and my boyfriend is interested in going to places with heavy anime influence. We both like art museums, and will prioritize early mornings exploring Tokyo and Kyoto to nightlife, though we‚Äôd like to go out in Tokyo at least once.

We‚Äôre also both heavily tattooed, so as much as we‚Äôd like to engage in onsen culture, we may skip it this trip lacking experience in this area.

Leaving the final 2 days in Tokyo to explore and hit the spots we may have missed.",https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1fd2m98/itinerary_check_first_timers_in_tokyo_kyoto/,"I noticed you said your BF is interested in anime related stuff, yet no mention of Akihabara or Ikebukoro, which would be two big places to hunt  for that stuff. 

Also, Ueno and Akihabara are nearly adjacent, with the Ameyoko shopping street stretching South from Ueno station. It‚Äôs mostly street food these days, I‚Äôve read. Not a bad thing, but I guess no longer a Mecca for cheap clothes. 

Some anime notes:
 - Tokyo contains several locations from Makoto Shinkai films, including Garden of Words (Shinjuku Gyoen Park) and Your Name (the steps and bridge from famous scenes in the movie)
 - Sound Euphonium is set in Uji, just a short ride on the subway a few stops south from Fushimi Inari Taisha in Kyoto. The school (KitaUji) exists, as well as the bridge used in several key scenes, the small Insel park on the river, and the scenic overlook of the town (short hike)
 - Omi Jingu shrine in Kyoto is featured in Chihayafuru

Game wise:
 - Paranormasight uses real locations from Sumida Ward, including the nondescript yet now spooky park, and the nicer Former Yasuda garden
 - Persona 5 has tons of Tokyo locations, better to web search them in advance; the hangout above the scramble is easy yet tricky to find
 - Yakuza games are basically set in Kabukicho in Shunjuku. You‚Äôre staying there so that should be an easy one. 

I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs plenty more, but maybe this might encourage a quick check on what shows your BF knows and might have interest in seeing RL locations.. if any such opportunities exist. Attack on Titan fans would of course be out of luck for trying to hunt down locations. 

Onsen wise, I was looking it up for other reasons, but there‚Äôs a natural spring Onsen bath house I found near Kamata station (not too far from Haneda airport) called Hasunuma Onsen. One of the blurbs I read said it was tattoo friendly (you‚Äôd have to confirm). I‚Äôm sure there are other options, but I think it‚Äôs a little tough to find natural spring Onsen in Tokyo (versus regular hot bath water), which is why I was interested in this find. Good reviews but I wasn‚Äôt able to make it down (I picked a hotel in Kichijoji, which is very inconvenient to southeast parts of Tokyo).","Generally well spaced out itinerary. However, your Kyoto leg looks underwhelming. Your itinerary includes Gotokuji near Tokyo (mostly a tourist trap) but not Kiyomizudera or Kinkakuji or Heian-jingu in Kyoto? If both of you really like culture, these are a few of the unmissable shrines / temples in Kyoto. I‚Äôd also highly recommend a night walking tour of Gion & hanging out in Pontocho Alley in Kyoto",,,

1fiusmp,[Itinerary check] Tokyo with emphasis on day trips (Late Nov-Early Dec),"Hi friends, I'm planning a trip to Tokyo region for my parents to Tokyo in late Nov-early Dec 2024.

They really love nature, scenic areas and do not mind travelling/walking a fair amount. They don't enjoy nightlife, are ok with shopping and eating, but prioritise sightseeing.

We have already booked accommodation within 800m/walking distance of Tokyo Station. We are likely going to get the Tokyo Wide pass (which will help in terms of travel to Kawaguchiko and Karuizawa), and also since they don't drive!

Would appreciate your feedback/comments/recommendations on my itinerary. Would appreciate any tips too, especially wrt Karuizawa and Atami!

**29/11 - arrival in Tokyo/chill day**

* Touch down at 0615 (note: overnight flight)
* Reach hotel latest 1000, care off luggage
* Have breakfast or brunch
* Chill time near the hotel (options):

1. Around Tokyo Station area/cafe.¬†
2. Tokyo station gallery (closes 1800)

* Head back to hotel at 1500 to rest
* 1800 head out for dinner
* Head to Uniqlo Ginza Flagship store (closes at 2100)
* Head back to hotel to rest

(Alt, it may be more logical to head to Uniqlo Ginza Flagship store after breakfast or brunch, then go back to rest at 1500, before exploring tokyo station area at night. Alternatively, scrap the night plan and just chill and rest.)

**30/11 - autumn foliage day**

* Shinjuku Gyoen National Garden (Sendagaya JR) - reach about 1000, and finish with something at starbucks inside before heading for lunch in the vicinity)
* Meiji Jingu Gaien/Gingko Avenue (Shinanomachi JR, 1 stop from Sendagaya JR) (peak time is 25/11-3/12, will light up from 1630-1930). Can reach here about 1530, and see it in daylight and when lighted up
* Free and easy

**1/12 (tokyo wide pass) - Day trip to Karuizawa**

* Travel 1h 15 min directly via shinkansen
* Prince shopping plaza
* Yagasaki Park
* Old Karuizawa Ginza Street

**2/12 (tokyo wide pass) - Day trip to Fuji/Kawaguchiko**

* Take Fuji express direct train early
* Reach kawaguchiko
* Take red omni bus to ropeway - do the ropeway
* Take red bus to one museum/place of attraction (either the museum of art, itchiku kubota art museum or NLC/oishi park)
* Consider momoji corridor (?)
* Take Fuji express back
* Prepare to postpone/sacrifice this day if weather is unfavorable

**3/12 (tokyo wide pass) - Atami/Yokohama**

* Take Odoriko No. 5
* Reach Atami by lunch time, explore the town, shopping streets, coast
* Take the train to Yokohama around 1700
* Explore Minato Mirai/dinner
* Head back

**4/12 - Chill day**

* Half day free (am looking for recommendations here :)
* Shibuya sky (late afternoon/evening- to catch both day and night views)
* Shibuya crossing
* Shibuya Hachiko statue¬†
* Shibuya blue cave illumination (starts from 1/12) \^

**5/12 - Chill day**

* Checkout and leave luggage with hotel
* Tsujiki outer market (?)
* Can hit Uniqlo Ginza if not hit yet
* 1500 start leaving for Narita Airport hotel

**6/12 - Flight home**

* Early morning flight home around 0500

And even the prices are better. Instead of a chill day, maybe take an earlier airport bus and then shuttle bus to the hotel.

Any feedback on our itinerary would be appreciated! We‚Äôre especially looking for food recommendations and any tips to make the most of our time with a toddler. Thanks so much for your help! (Yes ChatGPT wrote this post for me) lol ",https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1fi4u28/itinerary_feedback_17_days_in_japan/,"Way too spread out, each city only get one or half day, would be way more specific on where to go. 17 days are perfect for Kansai + Tokyo if you space them well. Always don‚Äôt be too greedy on trips as it‚Äôs not a mission, you‚Äôre supposed to be chill. 

Here‚Äôs my recommendation 

9 days Kansai, 8 days Tokyo

In that 9 days, 4 days Osaka, 1 day Nara, 4 days Kyoto

All of them are decent sized cities, so there will be a lot of things for you to do","i am leaving tomorrow, also entering at Osaka. I will do 3 days Osaka (1 day USJ, 1 daytrip Hiroshima, 1 day Osaka), 3 days Kyoto, 1 night Hakone and then 7 days in Kyoto :)","Day 11- buses take you everywhere there. You could go to Yumoto and walk along the lake, check the sulphur-infused water coming out of the ground on the back of the town and use the free footbath. There's also Ryuzu and Yudaki falls on the way to Yumoto. And Shinky≈ç Bridge when you get to Nikko, before the temples.

Day 12- Go to the free observatory of the Asakusa Tourist Information Center for great views of Senso-Ji.

Day 13- I'd say that the whole walk along the waterfront from Minato Mirai to the British House is incredible and more than enough, no need to go all the wat to Sankeien Garden unless there's something in particular you want to see there.

Day 16- Go to the Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building free observatory.",[removed],
1fhq4si,Shinhotaka Ropeway to OkuHotaka to Kamikochi to Takayama. Am I crazy,"Hello Friends. 

  
I am planning a 3 week long trip through Japan and I am planning 2 days in the mountains near Kamikochi in the end of September. The first day I plan travel from Tokyo as early in the morning as possible and arrive near base of Yakedake by Nakanoyu Onsen and out-and-back to the summit and then bus to my lodging in Hirayu. This should only be a 4-5 mile trip and I think I feel safe with this one. Please let me know if that's even insane to do.

  
The next days plan seems like my real worry. I plan to wake up in Hirayu, take bus to Shinhotaka Ropeway, ascend ropeway and hike to Nishiho Sanso, hike along ridge to Okuhotaka summit, descend to Kamikochi near the post office in Rt 24, and then bus to Takayama and end the day. 

  
Let me start off by saying that I am an experienced hiker/backpacker have a healthy confidence in myself and my fitness. I have summitted many mountains in the US and I know these attempts should be taken very seriously. I have a healthy respect for mountains and I'm not going to act like I can do anything because mountains have humbled me more than once. I just view this as somewhat realistic due to the Ropeway taking away most of the ascent and me being able to focus the entire day on the traverse. I have mapped this route out on AllTrails and it shows it as a 7.9 mile hike w/ an initial 3000 ft elevation gain followed by 5500 ft elevation loss which seems doable especially if i get an early start and I am able to send my luggage to Takayama to wait for me.

  
My worries are the following:

* The hike is actually insanely difficult and will be very slow going the entire time. 
* The travel from Kamikochi to Takayama will be difficult to make in time. I believe last bus leaves at 5:30 PM. (Also I hear mixed reviews on how available this transportation is and I am not sure if booking in advance for this is necessary or not.)
* Weather will be very cold. I plan on running a wool underlayer, trail pants/t-shirt mid layer, down jacket, beanie which should be good but I am not positive.

  
As you can see I have some worries. I appreciate any advice you can give. I am sure I am ignorant of some key parts here but the bones of the plan are laid out. If this ends up being to insane I will audible to another day hike somewhere in the area that is more attainable, perhaps same trek starting at top of the Ropeway but avoiding Okuhotaka summit and just descending to Kamikochi from Nishiho Sanso. If you have any substitute day hike suggestions I would love to hear them. Again I apologize for any ignorance or silliness of this plan. Somehow it does seem realistic to me but I could be very mistaken. Thanks again in advance friends. 

  
",https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1fhq4si/shinhotaka_ropeway_to_okuhotaka_to_kamikochi_to/,"I‚Äôve hiked a lot and my son lived near Okuhida for two years. If you‚Äôre fit the hikes are doable as long as the transport goes right. Yakedake is a fairly strenuous hike - again if you‚Äôre fit and the weather is good your calculations are good. Yakedake is not insanely difficult and there are no technical portions. A couple of places they have cables you can help you up steep portions. Note that the mountain hut on the way up to Yakedake may be closed.

Ropeway hike. The last time we were there the ropeway was down. We tried to go up from Kamikochi- that is an insanely difficult hike. Straight up with few switchbacks. Doing it from the ropeway and the descending may be ok - expect the descent to be very steep . Our son had done the up and down in about 6 hours but he is extremely fit. I believe the mountain hut up on top should be open but check.

If you get bluebird days it is absolutely beautiful and you can soak in in onsen when done.","The gendarme traverse that you mentioned from Nishiho to Okuho is not a hike. It‚Äôs a very technical and exposed scramble or climb. It‚Äôs considered japans most difficult traverse possible without the help of ropes and harness.

Alltrails is not a reliable site to plan hikes like that in Japan. It‚Äôs not used by Japanese and the traverse you chose is mostly climbed by Japanese hikers. Have a look at Yamap or yamareco

Lastly I‚Äôm not sure why you think you can do this hike in 1 day. It‚Äôs generally considered to be 2-3 days. You‚Äôll also need a helmet and gloves with rubber coating for grip on the chains.

And yes, this post does sound a bit ignorant considering what you‚Äôre planning to do ;)

https://www.allthepeaks.com/post/gendarme

For an also challenging and dangerous hike but less than Gendarme I would go up from Dakezawa to Okuho, stay the night and then loop down through Karasawa:

1fgrwdx,Back-to-back Kusatsu Onsen and Yamanochi Snow Monkey Park,"In Nagano, we didn't find much that appealed to us, so we decided to only visit Snow Monkey Park and stay in one of the hotels or ryokans in Kusatsu with private onsens instead. Trying to figure out whether this is doable on our November trip to Japan and appreciate any suggestions/tips.

We will be checking-out of our hotel in Akasaka, Tokyo on November 14th. I understand from the schedule shown in Google Maps that it would be possible to arrive at Snow Monkey Park around 10:30, if we leave Tokyo around 06:00. I am guessing that it would take 2.5 hours at most to visit the park, even in mildly challenging weather. So, I thought we might move to Kusatsu in the afternoon, i.e. around 13:30. Unfortunately, I was unable to find a viable travel option.

I understand that there aren't any direct train services between two places, and with the options shown on Google Maps, we easily lose a day if we choose trains. Only option seems to be the ""Nagaden Bus"", which uses the shortest ""Shiga Kusatsu Kogen Route"" (a.k.a. Japanese National Route 292) and can arrive in Kusatsu in around 1.5 hours. However, there seems to be only one service at around 10:30, no other schedules available during the day.

There is another caveat with ""Nagaden Bus""; I read from several sources that the Shiga Kusatsu Kogen Route only opens from May to mid/late November, so it might not be available for our dates. I am afraid that reversing our course (arriving and staying in Kusatsu first, visiting the park the next morning) won't solve our problem for the same reason. Being unable to use the shortest route hinders renting a car, even if I find the courage to drive in a country where traffic moves on the left.

So, what do you think? Is there an alternative I am missing? Kanazawa would be the next stop on our journey. We might consider skipping the park if this is not possible.",https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1fgrwdx/backtoback_kusatsu_onsen_and_yamanochi_snow/,There are some great onsens close to Jigokudani park  - try Shibu Onsen - it's a small town that is just a few minutes from the park and has many onsen hotels.,"I cannot offer you any advice, but I am sympathetic towards you. I had this whole plan figured out about how I was going to travel from Nagano to Kusatsu... The thing is, everybody always says that public transport is amazing in Japan, which it is, but in cities like Kyoto. Public transport in Kusatsu, Hakone, Star Village Achi, Funaya, basically less populated places, is really difficult to navigate around sometimes. With Star Village Achi, if the bus is full, a taxi it is.",[removed],"What's the rest of your itinerary? There is a sort of comparable monkey park in Arashiyama near Kyoto. 

I am also going to Nagano using public transit in November and have changed itinerary plans a LOT due to stuff being so far apart. I'm not particularly interested in the monkey park but definitely want to see Togakushi Shrine, Zenkoji, and some hikes/cycling further south closer to Matsumoto.","Did you try Shibu Onsen? Would love to hear about your trip. Planning for February, nothing booked yet other than flights."

Thank you all for your suggestions ",https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1ffg8ta/feedback_on_my_9day_japan_itinerary_please_first/,Kyoto and Osaka aren't reasonable day trips from Tokyo - especially not back to back.,"Just stay a few nights in Kyoto. Is there a reason you aren't? You are wasting a lot of time and money going back and forth. 2.5 hours and about $135 CAD every time you take the trip. You are spending an extra 5 hours and $270 on the train when you could just stay in Kyoto, which is 30 minutes from Osaka. Then you could stop at Kawaguchiko on the way back which would save some time as well.

As is, you are going to feel like half your trip is on trains.","Osaka is further in the same direction as Kyoto from Tokyo. It makes no sense to go back to Tokyo and then out to Osaka again. 

Have a rest day in the middle where you book a ryokan or visit an onsen or otherwise have nothing planned.","Day 4 is a crazy packed Kyoto schedule, even if you were based in Kyoto. Fushimi Inari is at least 2 hours, Kiyomizu-dera is at least an hour. Arashiyama might be shorter, but it's on the other side of town. I would pick 2 if you're based in Kyoto, pick 1 if it's a day trip (assuming no crazy arrive early/depart late).

Like the others said, it'd probably be best to do at least a night in Kyoto.",

* Afternoon: Arrive in Hakodate, check in to Ryokan, explore Bay Area and Kanemori Red Brick Warehouses, Take ropeway to Mt Hakodate for sunset view
* Evening: Return to ryokan for dinner and evening relaxation in onsen

***3 January -***  Hakodate --> Niseko

* Morning: Hakodate Morning Market for breakfast (there is this squid and crab bowl that I saw advertised somewhere and I'm determined to find it and eat it). Depart Hakodate for Niseko via bus transfer to Grand Hirafu
* Afternoon: Arrive at hotel in Niseko, get settled in to room then get fitted for ski rentals.
* Evening: Hopefully find somewhere to get ramen or curry for dinner and have an early night

***4 January -***  Niseko

* Morning: Breakfast at hotel then pick up ski rentals
* Ski Day
* Evening: Dinner reservation at Kamimura 

***5 January -***  Niseko

* Ski Day

***6 January -***  Niseko

* Final Ski Day
* Return rentals at hotel, pack up room

***7 January -***  Niseko --> Sapporo

* Morning: Conbini breakfast and take bus from Niseko to Sapporo
* I don't have plans for Sapporo but I really want to check out the Sapporo Beer Factory, and just see the city in January/winter

***8 January -***  Sapporo

* Still ironing out plans for Sapporo. ***Is it worth it to stay in Sapporo for this full day and night and leave the following morning for Tokyo, or should we maximize our time in Tokyo and fly out tonight?***
* Evening: EITHER Stay in Sapporo, go out for dinner & drinks OR head to CTS to catch a late flight back to TYO

***9 January -***  Sapporo --> Tokyo

* Morning: If we do stay the night we will try to get an early flight back to Tokyo, like 10am, so that we can get to our hotel relatively early and still have a good chunk of time in Tokyo that day.

***10 January TO 13 January-***  Tokyo

* I want to leave this part of the trip open to be a little more flexible with our time. I know I want to go to Kappabashi Street, we would like to check out a Sumo match if we can, we have tattoo appointments booked for one morning, definitely Tsukiji Fish Market and hopefully a Tuna auction if we can get the lottery right, TeamLabs or Borderless (I don't think we need to see both, but let me know if I'm wrong), and all the other quintessential Tokyo must-sees. 
* If there's anything glaring that I haven't included or something you would recommend that isn't commonly suggested we'd love to hear it. 

***13 January -***  Tokyo

* 2030 Leave Tokyo via HND back to the US.



So, if you've made it this far I would love to hear any suggestions or critiques of this itinerary and especially what you would do about visiting Sapporo. As I see it we have three options:

1. Spend 1 night in Sapporo with a half day before and after (This would get us back to Tokyo on the night of January 8th)
2. Spend 2 nights in Sapporo with a half day before and then a full day in between (This would get us back to Tokyo in the early afternoon on January 9th)
3. Spend 0 nights in Sapporo and go straight to CTS from Niseko to return to Tokyo (This would get us back to Tokyo in the early evening of January 7th).


We are leaning towards option 2 but are interested in your thoughts. Thanks in advance for the help!",https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1fet6zh/itinerary_check_jan_2025_in_tokyo_and_hokkaido/,"I haven‚Äôt been to Gonpachi in years. It was popular with Roppongi I-bankers and ex-pat lawyers who wanted that ‚ÄúJapanese feel‚Äù without actually having to go somewhere out of their safety zone. The food was mediocre, from what I recall.","I love Sapporo, it's probably one of my favorite cities in Japan. There is just so much for foodies, and it's obviously not MASSIVE like Tokyo.

There are lots of local regional specialties in Sapporo, and even the sushi is unique from Tokyo:

1. Miso Ramen (I recommend Ramen Shingen)

2. Soup Curry 

3. Yakitori (my recommendation is closing this Sept, so I don't have a new one)

4. Sushi - Sushi Kin

5. Nikka's HQ is in the closeby city of Otaru, but in Sapporo there is Nikka bar. We had to make reservations but got to try some Japan exclusives

Are you staying at the Andaz Tokyo? I anticipate the rooftop bar to be very busy for the holidays and preferred access will be given to guests. Finally, I don't recommend having a birthday dinner on arrival day since you'll be battling jetlag/appetite woes/energy levels. Unless of course your birthday is on 12/30",I would suggesting staying the extra night in Sapporo. There is a lot of great food to eat so you will have plenty to do. Also a day trip to Otaru is always recommended so you can spend some time on the 8th there.,Sounds great! Have you considered doing it maybe in February with the Sapporo snow festival?,"By TeamLab or Borderless you mean Planets vs Borderless?

They are two different experiences. If you can, visit both. But if you want to choose between the two, Planets is more interactive and Borderless is more visually immersive."

There's not a lot I care to see in Osaka, but it was a must-do for my daughter, so we are staying there instead of making it a day trip.",https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1fcbsch/itinerary_suggestions_for_momdaughter_trip/,[deleted],i‚Äôm trying to plan a trip with my mom too:),"If shes into Demon Slayer anime, she might like Ashikaga Flower Park.

1fb4lc9,A beginner's attempt at a Tokyo/Kyoto/Hiroshima itinerary - comments are welcome!,"Hi everyone. Me and my girlfriend are planning a \~two week trip to Japan next year (spring or autumn). This time I thought it would be fun to try out making a more specific itinerary, since before I've always just pretty much done everything spontaneously, but the places I've visited have always been smaller, closer to home in Europe and the trips have been shorter.

Tbh this itinerary was made in a very short time, and I don't have practically any beforehand knowledge about travelling in Japan, so I wouldn't be surprised if there are some clear issues. Obviously there's still so much time before the actual trip, so I mostly did this already just for fun and to get some idea what the trip could be like. That's why all kinds of comments and critiques are welcome.

We are both interested in culture and history, and also appreciate nature and overall wandering around, taking in the different vibes of different locations. I think the most important thing is that the days don't get too full and we have time to just sit down in some random cafe and relax also. I am not sure have I achieved this with this itinerary or not, but we want the trip to be relaxed enough, even though there's a lot to see. We don't mind 'mainstream touristy sightseeing' if the places are actually worth seeing and not complete tourist traps. Even though we are not particularly fans of huge crowds, we also understand that they can't be avoided during a trip like this. We are also both very interested in local cuisine, but I have not included any restaurants in this itinerary yet. The plan is to eat out twice a day anyway, of course restaurant recommendations are also welcome. I was thinking something like one dinner in a fine dining, Michelin starred place and besides that, we'd prefer if the food budget wouldn't get overwhelming :) mid-range or something.

**Day 1 (Tokyo)**

Asakusa area, visiting Senso-ji

What do you guys think?",https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1fb4lc9/a_beginners_attempt_at_a_tokyokyotohiroshima/,"Day 5, 2 museums in a day is a lot of museums!

Day 6, Nishiki market is kind of a day/afternoon thing, so you might want to do that first.

Day 9, you might want to just Uber back. I spent a day at Arashiyama and walked 40k steps.

Recommend lunch at Muromachi Wakuden in Kyoto. Make a reservation. It's very good value for the base course. I think it's around $80.",There's a shop in uji where you can grind tea into matcha it was fun. But being really into tea l reccomend going to Obubu tea farm for a tour over uji.¬†,"Visiting Ryoan-ji but not Kinkaku-ji kinda makes me a little sad, not gonna lie. Other than that I think your itinerary is very solid for a rough draft.

I'd recommend flying out of KIX if you can to save you a bit of money on that last Osaka-Tokyo train trip.","Looks good, my biggest recommendation is wake up really early for everything in Kyoto to avoid crowds. With Fushimi, don‚Äôt take pictures at the bottom, brisk walk for 10-20 minutes to get out of the crowds, there‚Äôs about 1 hours worth of hiking a worth or gates. Also, I don‚Äôt bother trying to avoid wverybodies pictures, you‚Äôll be there for an extra half an hour+

Can‚Äôt remember the name, but there‚Äôs a very mini version of arashiyama at the top of the philosophers path, if you want pics go there before or after.

I‚Äôd do arashiyama before 8am. No point after. Too busy, it‚Äôs disappointing and not relaxing at all.¬†

1fa4dma,Itinerary check - 12 days in Japan,"My SO and I will be spending 12 days in Japan in 2 weeks. We are not crazy ambitious travelers (as in cram as much as possible) but do like seeing the weird/offbeat things. I feel this trip is a pretty standard first time trip to Japan.

Some questions:

1. Think our day in Shibuya/Shinjuku is attainable? It's our 1 really packed day. If there are other days that seem too packed or are inefficient or perhaps not packed enough, let us know.

2. Our day in Nara is relatively light; any chance it would be possible to stop by Uji for a tea festival without breaking our backs?

3. I wanted 1 or 2 ""fine dining"" experiences while in Japan. Probably 1 in Tokyo and the other in the Kansai region. It doesn't need to be super expensive, but something that is by reservation and has good ambiance and above average food. Any recommendations?

4. I only have like 5 or 6 specific food places planned; otherwise, the rest is just what we're around. I figure the ""popular"" name places probably won't be as good as just some mom and pop hole in the wall. Anyone feel differently?

5. IC card and Shinkansen are confusing the hell out of me for travel. Correct me if I'm wrong but I can use an IC card like Suica for basically all the train/bus travel on my itinerary EXCEPT my trips from Tokyo to Kyoto, Kyoto to Hakone, and Hakone to Haneda? I haven't bought an IC card yet because every time I look into it, it just confuses me further in terms of what it actually covers.

Travel to Haneda and fly out",https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1fa4dma/itinerary_check_12_days_in_japan/,"Stay away from that hedgehog joint. Clawing at shy, nocturnal animals in the daytime is no way to spend a holiday.",[removed],"Please don't visit animal cafes. They exist largely due to Japan's lax animal welfare laws. Hedgehogs and other non-domesticated animals don't belong in cafes.

Regarding your question about Nara, the Nara Park circuit takes most of a day and there's lots of other things to see there. I'd suggest allocating a full day to the city.","You said you are not ambitious travelers but your itinerary says otherwise...

Mostly because you underestimate how big everywhere is, Ueno park is big, it's big enough to house a zoo and 4 museums. Not to say you have to visit all the museum's but just want to give you perspective how big it is in terms of size. And you want to also do museum of sculpture before lunch in Ginza... That is very ambitious and kind of unnecessary because if you don't intend to visit any attractions in Ueno, simply going to the ""park"" itself is nothing really special (it can be any park in the world tbh). I would just go to asakura museum and go to lunch after.

Also if you're not a big shopper, why bother going to Harajuku? It's really a shopping district for boutiques and big fashion labels. There aren't really alot of good restaurants either to be honest, it takes a long time to navigate through all the streets, so don't feel obligated to go there just because it's a Gwen Stefani song.

And did you schedule 30min for teamlabs? That's really off. Last time I did borderless I was there for almost 3 hours just to see everything. Remember you are not the only visitor in japan! You can't breeze through places just because you have tickets. There are lines for getting into places, line up for different rooms, or the WASHROOM. 

If you're not into Osaka, skip it, hnestly don't get sucked into the whole idea of ""I must visit all these places I see on IG"". Well you can do that but you end up getting exactly the same experience and photos as thousands of people online. Do what makes you happy and what makes your experience special. If you don't like shopping, namba may not be for you either. Honestly unless you're going to Universal studios in Osaka, everything else you can get in Tokyo.",
1fidm0f,14 day itinerary check - Tokyo / Osaka / Kyoto / Yokohama,"Hi everyone, been lurking here and absorbing a lot of information to help plan our family's first trip.

We'll be going late October / early November, first time ever.

Here's what we're thinking of, for the 14 day trip:

day 1: fly into Haneda, stay in hotel by Shinagawa Station.

day 2 - 6: stay in Tokyo, try to see Shibuya Sky, Teamlabs Borderless, Ghibli museum.  Then wander around various parts of Tokyo and eat / shop / sight see.

Day 6: travel to Osaka, stay in hotel in Umeda as home base for Kyoto and Osaka

Day 6 - 11:  day trips to Kyoto (maybe 2-3 days) to see various temples, see Dontobori in Osaka, and 1-2 days in Osaka, day trip to Nara / Lake Biwa or Himeji

Day 11: travel to Yokohama, stay by Yokohama station hotel

Day 11 - 14: sight see ramen museum in Yokohama, day trips to Kamakura.

Day 14: head back to Haneda to fly home.

You can see the Dotonbori in under an hour imo. It's fun to walk through and take photos but it's basically Times Square. 

If you're planning multiple trips to Kyoto from Osaka, I'd recommend staying in Kyoto instead of going back and forth a lot. It's close but you can easy do 2-3 days in Kyoto and then a few days in Osaka.

Don't sleep on Tsukiji Market when you're in Tokyo. You're semi-close to it by train and it's a very unique experience, especially if you like seafood.",,,,

yes advisable to visit kiyomizu-dera early. 

in the PM you can maybe add fushimi inari or arashiyama/Tenruji Temple

you can basically just walk from Kiyomizu-dera to Kodaiji Temple then to Yasaka Shrine. 

  
for arashiyama and tenruji just take note that they're connected so you can basically enter tenruji and exit to the bamboo forest you'll basically skip the high traffic area of the bamboo forest which is the start.

I'm planning a trip to Japan for April 2025. I'm looking forward to cycling the Shimanami kaido over a few days possibly 3-4 (taking my time, making lots of detours)

Also what did you do with your luggage? Bring only the strict necessary for the cycle in a backpack, and leave the rest in a coin locker in Onomichi? The logistics of luggage has me stressed out honestly.

It was in June however so no cherry trees - but the Islands air smelled of grapefruits as they were growing all around!",
1fhpr02,16 days in Japan (Tokyo/Kawaguchiko/Izu/Kyoto/Hiroshima/Okinawa),"Hi all üòä My husband and I will be visiting Japan in late November and would be extremely grateful for help with our itinerary. We have both visited before with our families when we were little but this will be our first trip there together (it's kind of our honeymoon trip, although the first weekend there, one of us is attending a work conference in Tokyo).

One thing we're quite worried about is figuring out the public transport system. We've tried to look up routes and rough costs on Google Maps - if any transport guru could give them a once-over, we would be so grateful! Would it be worth it for us to get a JR pass or just use an IC card and buy shinkansen tickets individually?

We have a niggling feeling that we are maybe trying to fit in too much on some days and that the flow of events isn't the best for some days either...ü•∫Racking our brains has led us to this iteration of our itinerary but we feel a bit stuck on how we can streamline/improve it further. Very open to advice on what to cut out (e.g. are some things more worth seeing than others?) or how to better rearrange activities. Thanks all in advance!!üôè

   * relax

* visit TeamLab Future Park in Naha? 
   * how long should we allocate for this? would you recommend any other must-experience things around Naha while we're in that area?
   * guess getting easily to and from Naha would be the main reason why we'd rent a car in Okinawa rather than rely on the bus (not really planning to visit anywhere else but just focus on diving/snorkeling and chilling)

* Morning:
   * check out
   * travel back to Naha (by bus = 1.5h, by car = 1h but factor in time to return car)

   * be at Naha Airport by 1230pm 
   * 230pm flight home

We'll be eternally grateful for any advice \^ \^",https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1fhpr02/16_days_in_japan/,"Hi, firstly this seems like a really cool itinerary. I would like to suggest the following website which shows JR regional passes (as opposed to the JR national pass which imo is really expensive).

https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2357.html

There are many regional passes there, but to make it a bit less daunting, I suggest you may like to look at: 
- tokyo wide pass (3 day window which you may want to fit around the kawaguchiko/izu part)

Or the following which you may want to fit around the hiroshima part:
- west all areas pass
- kansai hiroshima pass
- setouchi area pass 
- sanyo sanin area pass

You would still have to look at the pass details, and check against individual trip prices (which I see you have already done meticulously) to see if its worth it. You can use Jorudan instead to check prices for more accuracy!

Please ask if you have more questions! All the best","Nice itinerary! I tried to find all you questions! Regarding Kawaguchiko there is another convenient option: Take a express bus from Shibuya! We did it several times and never had issues! 

Ubuya is nice but I would prefer the Wakakusa no Yado Maruei or the FuFu Kaemwaguchiko.

Car rental: Please check how you have to proceed with your drivers license. A German drivers license has to be translated in advance. Regarding companies I would prefer J net rental and they are close to Mishima Sta.

Ryokan near Kyoto Sta: have a look at Hokkaikan Ohanabo

Sagano Rail: I‚Äôm not 100% sure if it is even possible to walk from Adashino Nenbutsuji to Hohokyo totrokko Station‚Ä¶ booking on the official page should be fine and is cheaper than on klook. 

Diving in Okinawa: I was once able to see Manta rays near Ishigakijima island! Maybe that‚Äôs cool for you? 

TeamLab Naha: 3-4 hrs max 

Hope that helps!","The jr rail pass calculator tells you.

1fg9qag,Japan November Rough Itinerary (11/12-11/21),"Hello,

My mom and I will be traveling to Japan this upcoming November. It will be my third time in the past few years, but my mom's first time in a long while. I wanted to show her the biggest highlights to showcase the best that Japan has to offer, so I'm taking her to the big three cities. Anyways, here is my rough itinerary that I would love for you guys to mull through and tell me where I can improve! Thank you in advance.

11/12 - Flight from LAX to HND

11/13 - Remainder of day will try to visit Shibuya Sky and Harajuku, get situated in our hotel and look around Tokyo

11/14 - Meiji Jingu Shrine, Akihabara, TeamLab Borderless

11/15 - Shinjuku Gyoen National Garden, Senso-ji Temple, Pokemon Center (Pokemon Cafe if we can get a reservation)

11/16 - either day trip to Kamakura or Nikko (Kamakura mainly for the beaches and Nikko for the waterfalls)

11/17 - travel to Kyoto, check out Kiyomizu-dera Temple and Gion

11/18 - Arashiyama Bamboo Grove, Fushimi Inari Shrine

11/19 - travel to Osaka, check out Shinsaibashi and Dotonbori

11/20 - trip to Kyoto Nintendo Museum, Nara Park if we have leftover time

11/21 - return to Tokyo and fly back home from HND to LAX

We will try to budget ourselves to everything between us being within $5k USD.",https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1fg9qag/japan_november_rough_itinerary_11121121/,"Hey you :) so Tokyo looks fine to me. You could look up online what is happening in November in Nikko/Kamakura and see what you prefer and hoe the weather is then. Just so you know, fushimi Inari is at the other end of the city and Arashiyama at the other, but if that is fine with you then that‚Äôs okay. Then going to osaka and returning to kyoto just for the museum is kind of a weird plan. If you plan to only going to the start of the gates in fushimi inari then maybe go there on your first day of kyoto. Then do bamboo forest and museum at the same day. Then you would have time for nara. But if that is too packed for a first day in kyoto then i would do as you said. Hope this helps and have a nice trip with your mom :)",These are close to the days we plan on going. I‚Äôm saving this post so I can look up these places.,"I probably wouldn‚Äôt take my mom (again) to Akihabara, I‚Äôd spend more time at Azabudai hills (where TeamLabs Borderless is at)

Arashiyama and Fushimi are on two opposite sides, if you can swing a taxi it might be feasible but its gonna be a LONG day with lots of walking

I do not advise traveling back to Tokyo and flying out on the same day",,

",https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1fg2wxq/first_time_to_japan_itinerary_check/,"I suggest pulling up a map and plotting a list. Some of these days don't make the most sense. For instance:

>Tuesday, November 5th

>Tsukiji Outer Market.

>Shopping:

>Itoya in Ginza

>Shibuya Loft

>Mega Don Quijote Shibuya.

>Azabu Juban

I assume you're staying in Ueno, since you're going to Ameyoko on your first night.

So - on November 5th, you have Ueno down to Tsukiji (30min+ train) to Ginza (15min nearby) then over east to Shibuya (30+min train) then back west to Azabujuban (30-40min train) and then back to Ueno (40min+ train)?

It's all over the place, backtracking all along the way. 5 neighborhoods is too much. And then the very next day you're going back to Shibuya and Azabujuban anyway. It would make more sense to group neighborhood activities together, rather than spreading them out over inconveniently traveled days. This is going to free up some more time to explore other cool neighborhoods that you don't have on your list, as well (Koenji/Asagaya, Ebisu/Nakameguro/Daikanyama, Jiyugaoka, Sangenjaya, etc.).","Try to map out all the areas you listed using google maps or wanderlog. Otherwise, you will be spending most of your time inside trains or buses.","Did you mean to put Spa World down twice? I only spent 3-4 hours there, not an entire day. If you are going there Thursday you could do a day trip on Saturday, perhaps to Arima Onsen near Kobe.

On your Arashiyama day consider adding Tenzan-No-Yu Onsen which is nearby. The attached restaurant is excellent as well.","This is a bit all over the shop. 

Try and cluster things together geographically on the same day.

You've generally got too many things on most days, pick just 2 or 3. 

Way too many temples overall, you'll be templed out after the third day in Kyoto.","Re: Record Shopping - I‚Äôm not sure how serious you are about, but here are a few thoughts. 
The Shibuya itinerary looks good, you may consider adding in some digging in Shinjuku/Shimokitazawa as well.  
Osaka also has a ton of record stores in Americamura that are worth checking out.  
Also, dropping into a BookOff is always fun."
1fduvwf,Itinerary Check - First Time 14-day trip starting mid November,"I will be there November 12 - 26. I (42M) am actually traveling with my parents (70), who are both active and fit, but they are 70. This is their second time, last time being in 2019. They're not the types to be into ""must visit"" places, especially for eating, so famous places to eat aren't really on the radar. I've read and fully believe there's good food to be had everywhere in Japan. 

There'll be times when we separate, so I'll be on my own for a portion, probably when I want to do some shopping or visit cocktail bars. I also plan to run while there, and Tokyo seems like a very runner-friendly big city.

Nothing is truly set in terms of activities. There just seems to be so much to see, and I understand there'll be hordes of tourists so I'm flexible. My parents and I are morning people, so we plan to rise as early as possible to visit some places where crowds are expected (e.g. all the temples/shrines).

**November 12**

- Fly into Tokyo (land at 2:50 p.m.)

- Check into hotel (staying in Shinjuku area)

- nothing planned this first day except wandering around. I have an interest in cocktail bars so I plan to explore some in the relative vicinity (e.g. SG Club)

**November 13 (Tokyo)**

- Morning run around Imperial palace

- Meiji Shrine, Imperial Palace, Shinjuku National Garden (too much for a day?)

- one museum (maybe Nezu? IDK still researching, open to suggestions, less into modern than traditional)

- shopping around Shibuya/Ginza

- Golden Gai/Omoide Yokocho

**November 14 (Nikko)**

- train there and then rent car

- Toshugo Shrine, Shinkyo Bridge

- Tamozawa Imperial Villa

- light hiking around temple areas

**November 15 (Nikko)**

- Ryuzu Falls hike

- Ryuokuo Gorge (or just the walk)

- Senjogahara

- Kegon Falls

**November 16 (Tokyo)**

- explore neighborhoods (Nakameguro, Shimokitazawa, Kichijoji, Daikanyama)

**November 17 (Hakone)**

- Onsen

- open air museum

- ropeway

- Lake Ashinoko

**November 18 (Takayama)**

- Old Town

- honestly one thing I'm looking forward to here is the house (mix of traditional/modern with onsen/sauna) that we're renting

- Morning markets

- Hida Folk Village

- post war and ww2 museums

\*\*\* I'm actually debating whether to make this stop. The travel will be the farthest (looks like 5 hour train ride) and we're only staying a night. Is this worth it? 

**November 19-22 (Kyoto)**

(flexible on order)

- Fushimi-Inari-taisha

- Kiyomizu-dera

- Higashiyama

- Gion

- Arashiyama

- Nishiki Market

- Kinkakau-ji

- Ryoan-ji 

- Fushimi Sake Village

- running along Kamogawa River

- Bars: Bar Rocking Chair, Bee's Knees, L'escamoteur

**November 22-23 (Hiroshima)**

- Peace Park

- Atomic Bomb Dome

- Miyajima

- Yamato Museum

**November 23-24 (Osaka)**

 - Dotombori

- Osaka Castle

- Shinsaibashi-suji

- wandering around for food and drink

**November 24-26 (Back to Toyko)**

- exploring more neighborhoods 

- more runs

- teamlab (is this suitable for 70 YOs?)

- day trip to Kamakura

- fly out 26th (to Vietnam :-)

  
Thoughts? As I said, I'm pretty flexible on each day and can even change the overall itinerary (e.g. not sure if it's worth it going to Takayama for a night). Would there be any issue going back and forth to Tokyo like this? Not in travel difficulty, but would it make the visit weird in any way? Overall, I'm looking for a good mix of big city, history, nature with some shopping, and simple neighborhood wandering to visit cool cafes, cocktail bars, photography and just absorbing Japanese culture. I'll be back so no pressure to hit all the famous spots. Appreciate any input!



",https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1fduvwf/itinerary_check_first_time_14day_trip_starting/,"By my count, you and your parents will be staying in 9 different hotels/rentals, which is way too much for a 14 day trip.

Takayama for only one night after a 5 hour commute is a hard sell.

Try streamlining the dates as such:

* Nov 12 - 15 | Tokyo
* Nov 15 - 17 | Nikko
* Nov 17 - 21 | Kyoto
* Nov 21 - 22 | Hiroshima
* Nov 22 - 24 | Osaka 
* Nov 24 - 26 | Tokyo (can make Hakone a day trip from the day you leave from Osaka to go to Tokyo)","This is a lot. Nov. 13, for example, is just not physically possible. Slow down and relax a bit!","Second reply, to focus more on the itinerary rather than the parents/age issues..

I agree with the person who said your Nov 13 plan is unreasonable. I was in Shinjuku Gyoen for 90 minutes and it felt like we skipped much of it. If we hadn‚Äôt entered 90 minutes before it closed, we‚Äôd have stayed longer (notice my cool, accidental strategy to prevent staying there for more than 90 minutes lol). I assume Yoyogi/Meiji Jingu is similar in scale. The Imperial Palace grounds are also big, plus they‚Äôre a bit more of a trek to get to from Shinjuku (train changes, not super direct).  I‚Äôd say doing the three plus transit would be an easy 6 hours. Any museum worth going to should also need at least 2 hours. That‚Äôs 8 hours there. I don‚Äôt think shopping would be enjoyable at that point.

Plus, I recommend shopping at the end of your trip, when you no longer have any hotel changes to worry about. Shopping increases your luggage footprint and/or weight.

As far as Takayama goes, I think it depends on how you handle the hotel-changes. For me, hotel-change days were _the worst_ days. I had a suitcase + 2 shoulder bags. They were individually not bad at all, but all three at once was heavy and bulky. Bringing them on the train wasn‚Äôt too bad, but subways were more difficult since they were usually more packed and we frequently had to stand. Moving the luggage around the city often involved a few steps where I‚Äôd have to lift the suitcase. 

If you have to move around like that, I would cut either Takayama _or_ Hakone, and give the reclaimed day to the remaining destination. However, if you, say, used a Takkyubin service to move your bags from Tokyo to Kyoto, and just use a day bag with enough to last you those 2 nights, that might not be too bad. IMO, trains when you‚Äôre encumbered with your luggage are miserable. However, when you‚Äôre traveling light, they‚Äôre great times to relax! 

I feel like your Kyoto itinerary looks a little ambitious, but no sense in taking anything off the list. It can be aspirational. Just be flexible and don‚Äôt give your parents any grief if they need to slow down the pace a bit.","> November 13 (Tokyo)
one museum (maybe Nezu? IDK still researching, open to suggestions, less into modern than  

[The Nezu Museum](https://maps.app.goo.gl/PhPgLwbXU4t3eKb78) mainly showcases Japanese and East Asian art collected by a businessman who made his fortune in the railway industry in the early 1900s. It also has a famous Japanese garden. So, if you prefer modern art, you might be better off visiting another museum. For example, [the National Art Center](https://maps.app.goo.gl/mU2FDDHaiJA2Doqq9) in the same Minato Ward is a good choice‚Äîthe building itself is a work of art.",
1fd6ttt,Itinerary check for October visit,"It's my friend and I'd first time visit and we want it to go as smooth as possible, with the trip coming up i figured it was time to put together a basic itinerary. We're both the type to have only a few planned activities and the rest we just wander and see what we're feeling like. So listed here are the main points we'd be doing and anything not listed is up to the moment, unless something is specifically recommended. I was wondering about a couple of things that i might have to change though and wanted feedback on it. In particular we have a trip to Kanazawa in the middle but with how our schedule is we would barely be there a full day. Should i cut it and replace it with a day trip from Tokyo?

**Departure Day**",https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1fd6ttt/itinerary_check_for_october_visit/,Sounds nice! Which airport will you use to arrive and departure? I‚Äòm asking because you last hotel is a bit off the main sights in Tokyo and the Tozai Line needs about 20 minutes to get to Tokyo station for example. Maybe it could be more convenient for you to find a hotel closer to metro/train stations with airport access or to bus stops for the airport busses?,,,,

Obs Try Ohmi beef, Kobe Beef, Fried beef, Buta-Daigaku, Onsen",https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1fbntbo/first_trip_to_japan_13_days_november/,Those walks are too much,I don't understand why you're planning to routinely embark on very long walks around Japanese cities. Japan has the world's best public transport and it's easy to find routes via Google Maps and pay for travel with IC cards. Taxis are also easily available if you prefer. I suspect that you can completely re-work this itinerary with the time this frees up.,"The weekend of your arrival in Japan is the Culture Day long weekend. I suggest looking up interesting cultural events in Osaka, Kyoto or Nara to go to. Your best bet would be key temples or museums in the area.",">Teamlabs Borderless 17:00h  
>1h Walk to  
>Jingu Gaien Ginkgo

Probably won't take 1 hr to walk. It usually take me about an hour to walk from Azabudai (where Teamlabs Borderless is located) to Shinjuku. I usually walk to get on the first Odakyu line from Shinjuku when climbing Mt.Fuji.

There isn't a direct line from Azabudai to Gaien-mae station. Can walk to Roppongi ichome station and get on the Nambu line and transfer at Akasaka Mitsuke station to Ginza line.

If riding the subway, it may be better to get a 3 day pass. Osaka has a similar subway 1 day pass.

[Tokyo Subway Ticket](https://www.kotsu.metro.tokyo.jp/subway/fare/otoku_limited.html)

I have to say that I love to walk and walked around Tokyo and Osaka too instead of riding on the subway. Walking around and looking at the neighborhood is fun. On the down side, it's going to take more time to get around. If you have planned sites to visit, it may be better to take the subway instead of walking. I was walking around most of the time in Osaka because I was working for an Osaka company and used my weekends.

Kyoto doesn't have subway to get around all the sites and the sites were pretty far away so I took the bus and train around. Need to set up a schedule to adjust to the bus schedule.",Excessive walking. Try busses. Look at the times to get between places and a return.

EDIT ‚Äî After hearing some people‚Äôs feedback and some more research I decided to cancel my bookings at animal cafes as they seem to be very cruel and I don‚Äôt want to support these kinds of practices.

Good-bye. The owl cafes are just cruel. Owls should not be kept indoors like this.

See if you can use the hot spring without staying at the hotel. Changing hotels is a pain you don't need.","I just came back from a 11 day trip there so here are my thoughts while the trip is still fresh and I'm up due to jet lag. I also went last year too for the cherry blossoms.

Overall I think your itinerary makes a lot of sense. It covers a lot of good sites, without being overly ambitious. Many people try to pack in 8 things per day and the truth is, you will feel too rushed trying to get from place to place that way. A large part of the charm of Japan is serendipity and wandering around random streets and finding things that never even came onto your radar. It looks like you've built some of this exploring time in, which is wise.

A few random thoughts/opinions:

* We did Teamlab Planets last year and Borderless this year. I prefer Planets a lot more -- it was the highlight of the trip. So if you can, see if you can squeeze that one in.
* I would skip Nara -- I found it a long way to go for not a lot of cultural interest. I didn't find the deer park appealing at all.
* Fushimi Inari -- we climbed all the way to the top and it was great. We spent about 2ish hours taking our time getting up there, but it's worth it bc there are way fewer tourists at the top.
* We didn't end up using JR Pass at all -- we just got Suica cards loaded onto our iPhones and just topped it up whenever we needed to. It worked on every train we took (didn't do Shinkansen this time, but it works on all subways and JR Rail). Plus, Suica is accepted at 7-Elevens, Lawson and many other convenience stores.
* If you plan to shop, bring your passport around with you so you can save on tax. Some stores are setup for this, others you can reclaim tax after.
* Depending on where you live, I think you will find the food pretty inexpensive. I live in NYC and found the food in Japan incredibly good and about 1/3 the cost of the equivalent in NY. Try out the food at 7-Eleven, Family Mart and Lawson. It's fresh and quite good for the money. Also, a lot of department stores like Isetan, Takashimaya and others have incredible food in their basement levels that is pretty affordable.
* Kyoto was my favorite place by far. It just has such a different vibe from Tokyo and Osaka which are very busy and commercial. It does take a lot longer to get around, especially by bus so factor that in when you plan your temple visits. We only had a day there this trip so we just did Uber taxi to criss-cross town to see the shrines we wanted (Golden/Silver).
* If you find yourself with time at Tokyo station, there's good food all over, especially the 5-7th floors.
* There's lots of places for a good view. The Tokyo Metropolitan Government Buildings have a couple of observatories that are free. Highly recommend doing one of those if you can. And if you're around at night, I think they even do projection light shows on them starting at 7:30pm. 
* There are not a lot of garbage/recycling cans anywhere, yet the whole country looks immaculate. Be prepared to carry your trash for a while until you can dispose/recycle it properly. Also, some bathrooms don't offer hand dryers or paper towels, so keep some wipes/napkins handy. 
* If you have luggage that exceed 160cm (Lenght+Width+Height) you may have to book a special car on the Shinkansen for oversized luggage storage. Having said that, I would pack light as it's way easier to  get around crowded places with small luggage.
* There is a luggage forwarding service called Black Cat. We used this last year to forward a big suitcase to our final hotel. Along the way, we used carry-on luggage then extra duffel bags to accommodate purchases like snacks, souvenirs, etc. When we got to the final hotel, our big luggage was waiting for us and we then consolidated alot of our stuff into it. 
* Azabudai Hills is a fancy new mall where Teamlab Borderless is at. It is tricky to get around there, and not all that interesting. Skytree is a better visit IMO.
* If you're into coffee, visit Glitch. Totally worth the wait IMO.",I'd just stand at the entrance to Takeshita Street and try and grab a photo of yourself on the digital screen...but I'd by pass the whole street. It's overcrowded and not really that interesting. Just my personal opinion at the end of the day.

",https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1f9oaij/japan_10_day_itinerary_check/,Hmm if you could add more days to Kyoto otherwise you‚Äôre going to die of exhaustion my guy,"Your Day 8 in Kyoto sounds overly ambitious.  Was recently in Japan and did 2-day trip to Kyoto and even then we were not able to hit some of the top sight in Kyoto.  There is a lot to see and for most of the sites, it requires at least additional 15-20 min walking from the station to reach the spot.  Since you are doing a daytrip from Osaka, realistically you are probably only able to visit 2-3 sites a day before your legs will give up.","* Since you‚Äôll be staying in Tokyo for 3 days, I recommend getting a Tokyo Metro Pass to explore the city. It‚Äôs much cheaper than relying solely on a SUICA card.
* Consider buying the Kansai Pass on Klook will save your cost for access to Umeda Sky Building, Osaka Castle, and to travel around Osaka, Nara, and Kyoto.
* Wakakusayama in Nara offers a beautiful view of the city from the top.
* Fushimi Inari, Kiyomizudera-San/Ninnenzaka-Gion,  Arashiyama, and Yasaka Shrine are all far apart. I‚Äôm not sure if you‚Äôll be able to visit all of them in one day.",eSim via Ubigi us the way to go over wifi device.,
1f9nysc,~2 month itinerary check for 2024 Autumn across in Japan,"Hello all!

I know this sub sees a lot of itinerary checks so apologies in advance. I also understand that it's hard to really critique a trip of this length because I have a lot more time in specific locations. 

  
I'm mainly trying to discover some extra must sees. I have outlined many activities for days in some case, and these are more of ""possible activities"" rather than must do's. I am actively monitoring certain activities that I know require advanced booking as well.

  
General information:

Trip length: \~2 months

Start: Sep 19th 2024 (Not included because I arrive in at roughly 4pm)

General route idea: Tokyo -> into mountain towns -> back to osaka/Kyoto -> down to southern spots/Northern spots if better recommendations 

Interests include: 

* Nature hiking - more than likely bringing a tarp/bivy set up just in case
* Historical sites
* Music (would love venue recommendations for some good jazz)
* Nerd culture to a degree (Used to be pretty into anime and gaming, much less now but still enjoy the spectacle of it and all the characters from various anime or nintendo)
* BJJ / Combat sports - Definitely niche, I'd LOVE to watch sumo but I don't think I'll be there long enough.

Haven't planned much past this for the remaining 2ish weeks because it's hard to imagine what I'' do or what plans will change.

Thank you <3",https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1f9nysc/2_month_itinerary_check_for_2024_autumn_across_in/,"A bunch of the things you listed on your first point for Sept 20 should already have been done at the airport.

No idea where you are staying in Tokyo, but you are more likely going to take the train or subway in Tokyo than taking the bus.

22- Akihabara is not really a good morning spot. As most shopping oriented spots, they are not good for morning as the store open at 10-11 am (if not 12 in some case on weekdays). Kappabashi is between Ueno and Asakusa, kind of strange to put it on that day. Make no sense to go to Shinjuku on that days when you have a Shinjuku day the 25.

24 - if you do not already have the Ghibli museum ticket, then it's more likely not possible.

10 - Stayed at Shaq in Kanazawa, would not have any problem recommending it. The owner is really nice. Ask him about his bus accident  in South America.

23 - Do not understand why the day trip to Himeji if you do the Kumano kodo after then pass by Himeji on the way to Hiroshima after. I would stop by Himeji on the way to Hiroshima. Or I guess you would waste too much time on the train from Kii Katsuura... then why not stay in Himeji for a night, visit Himeji then move to Hiroshima. Can tell you the name of the hostel I went to in Himeji last year.",You should take 4-7 days and visit Okinawa. It's beautiful,,,

1fg31ym,Accessibility & Transit in Nikko,"Traveling to Japan in December 2024. My husband has limited mobility in his left leg and I'm curious on the accessibility and transit in Nikko, Japan. He mostly struggles with walking on uneven terrain - so he couldn't do like a hiking trail, but could do a well-worn path that is clear and relatively flat (stairs are fine with a railing). 

We are planning the following in Nikko:

Day 1 - Explore the main town site including Shinky≈ç Bridge, Nikkozan Rin‚Äôn≈çji Temple, Nikko Toshogu, Taiyu-in Temple, Shiraito Falls, Nikko Tamozawa Imperial Villa Memorial Park, Kanmangafuchi Abyss

Day 2 - Lake Ch≈´zenji area including Kegon Waterfall, Ryuzu Falls, then travelling to Oku-Nikko area to stay at an onsen for the night and maybe exploring Yuno Lake

Day 3 - Visiting whatever town site places we didn't make it to on Day 1 and returning to Tokyo

Any insight into Nikko's accessibility - are most of these places difficult for walking with uneven terrain? What about public transit within Nikko - will there be buses or taxi/Ubers available to reduce the physical toll?

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/JapanTravel) if you have any questions or concerns.*","I was in Nikko in Dec 2023, but we rented a car so didn‚Äôt use any public transport. We did take a cab from the Nikko train station up to our hotel the first night. (Please check your hotel bookings and ensure you don‚Äôt book up north from the station (where the Marriott is) - it‚Äôs a very steep up hill, with buses every hour if it comes, and is a 30 min walk up or down from Nikko station)

I remember the main town area and the temples had quite large and flat pedestrian walkways. To walk from Shinkyo Bridge to the temples area is an up slope if I remember correctly, perhaps you can use Google Street View to have a look at the terrain. The temples itself had quite a lot of stairs, but most, if not all, had railings.

As for the Lake area - I remember Kegon being fairly accessible. You get to below street level using lifts, and then it‚Äôs a fairly long path of stairs. Then it‚Äôs opens into a viewing platform with I believe some benches. The Lake Chuzenji area is ok for walking,I remember fairly wide pathways that were flat. But besides Kegon and the Lake, there wasn‚Äôt much else to do here. There was a lovely shop selling pottery near the Kegon Falls, and a few eateries and restaurants around. Then further down from the falls towards the lake, there are some local shops and cafes, but nothing very interesting.

Ryuzu Falls is further up the mountains from Lake Chuzenji (not walkable, you definitely need to find a bus or car up). It was pretty and we managed to have a good view of the bottom of the falls at a cafe, enjoying hot bowls of udon. Area around the cafe has steps up to a viewing platform. 

I spent the night up at Oku-Nikko, and visited Yuno Lake. Beautiful but extremely quiet and small town. Theres not much to do besides enjoy the onsen, take a look at Yuno Lake (beautiful, but you wouldn‚Äôt spend more than 10 minutes unless you want to just sit there in the snow) and use it as a base to do hiking a bit further down to view Yudaki Falls (my favourite of the three waterfalls I visited, but unfortunately it‚Äôs a lot of uneven steps to hike down that I slipped on multiple times in the snow and definitely not accessible) and hike at Senjogahara (not accessible). 

Your main accessibility problem away from the Nikko station town area would be snow making it slippery and difficult to walk through. It was snowing hard in early Dec last year. 

I think what you need to consider is to look up bus schedules in Nikko beyond the area around the train station. There are buses to the Lake Chuzenji area from Nikko and up to Oku-Nikko, but they may come only every hour or two. On top of that, it gets dark really fast in winter (sun starts to set at around 4pm) and the path between Lake Chuzenji and Oku-Nikko has no street lights, so its pitch black darkness after sunset. 

Nikko and the surrounding places is are some of the most beautiful and tranquil places I‚Äôve had the chance to enjoy, but if you are relying on public transport, you would need to do proper research or be prepared to spend good money on taking cabs. Otherwise if you can drive, I recommend renting a car. We got ours near the Nikko station, but check the forecast and absolutely get the snow tires if needed. We skidded near Oku-Nikko because it was pitch black and we did not expect fresh snow/ice forming in the time period we went.","https://www.accessible-japan.com/places/japan/tochigi-1/nikko/attractions/nikko-toshogu-shrine/

Here's a little info","There are buses that run from the station up to the top of town and drop off near the start of the walk to the wooded, hilly area where the temples and shrines are located. 

Walking around town is fine. Some of the paths around Toshogu-in are very wide and well-paved, but some are less even and well worn and might be more difficult for him. You‚Äôll really just have to see how you go and take care to stick to wider, flatter paths and accept that he may not be able to see everything. 

I haven‚Äôt been to the lakes area for 30 years so I can‚Äôt actually remember what the paths are like - hopefully someone else can chime in, or you can check at a tourist office in Nikko before you decide whether to head to the lake and waterfall.",

1fcfyd0,"Itinerary Check: 12 Days Tokyo - Kanazawa - Kyoto - Osaka. Landing on Saturday, September 14","My husband and I are visiting Japan for the first time. We land on Saturday, and we're super excited! We don't want to bite off more than we can chew, but we also want to see as much as possible (within reason) during our two-week trip. We've put together an itinerary, but we're struggling to edit it down and worry that we might be trying to do too much each day. We're coming from New York City, so our walking endurance is high.


We love everything food-related and are into stopping at random places and following our nose. We tend to play most of our travel by ear and are flexible to taking breaks if we're tired, but we want to have a general idea of what we should do each day (even if in the morning we change it based on what we saw the day before).


We‚Äôd love your thoughts on whether this plan is doable or if we should consider making some changes. Also, if there are any must-see spots we‚Äôre missing (like Himeji Castle?), please let us know!


Specifically, we have a few questions:

* Hakone Loop: Is it worth it to do the Hakone Loop even if the weather is cloudy? We‚Äôre considering getting a Hakone Free Pass and ending the trip at Hakone Yuryo. What do you think?

* Train Tickets: We are not getting the JR Rail Pass. Will it be difficult to get individual train tickets to each location the day before we travel? Should we purchase tickets in advance or wait until we arrive?

* Fushimi Inari and Nara: Can we visit Fushimi Inari before heading to Nara on the same day?

Regarding the JR pass, did you end up just doing trains a la carte or did you buy the pass? It seems if we are doing lots of travel in the Kansei area (Kobe/Nara/Osaka/Kyoto) maybe a regional pass would be good?

For otaru make sure to check out letao. The stores on that long touristy street mostly closed early - like 4pm.  I took the sunset canal cruise and meh though nice to be on the water.

The sapporo beer museum was very underwhelming and the beer garden also closes early - just go to the web site and make sure its something you like and make reservations for dinner if that is something you want. I enjoyed the my marumaya hike to the top. You can pick up hiking pools at the start. Though i took a back route that seemed easier than the path from the hiking poles - there are some surprisingly steep parts but then again there are also lots of elderly Japanese going up and down. There is also a temple in that park which had the only tree I saw with red leaves.

Soup curry, parfait, miso ramen, endless seafood dons are all good ideas for sapporo. The AOAO aquarium is good and open in the evening.","If you like whiskey and have the means to get there, go to the Yoichi distillery and museum in Yoichi, near Otaru.",,
1f9ykv4,Itinerary check - first time trip 12 days in Japan,"My SO and I will be spending 12 days in Japan in 2 weeks. We are not crazy ambitious travelers (as in cram as much as possible) but do like seeing the weird/offbeat things. I feel this trip is a pretty standard first time trip to Japan.

Some questions:

1. Think our day in Shibuya/Shinjuku is attainable? It's our 1 really packed day. If there are other days that seem too packed or are inefficient or perhaps not packed enough, let us know.

2. Our day in Nara is relatively light; any chance it would be possible to stop by Uji for a tea festival without breaking our backs?

3. I wanted 1 or 2 ""fine dining"" experiences while in Japan. Probably 1 in Tokyo and the other in the Kansai region. It doesn't need to be super expensive, but something that is by reservation and has good ambiance and above average food. Any recommendations?

4. I only have like 5 or 6 specific food places planned; otherwise, the rest is just what we're around. I figure the ""popular"" name places probably won't be as good as just some mom and pop hole in the wall. Anyone feel differently?

5. IC card and Shinkansen are confusing the hell out of me for travel. Correct me if I'm wrong but I can use an IC card like Suica for basically all the train/bus travel on my itinerary EXCEPT my trips from Tokyo to Kyoto, Kyoto to Hakone, and Hakone to Haneda? I haven't bought an IC card yet because every time I look into it, it just confuses me further in terms of what it actually covers.

I would remove that style. I would cut it down to the main things you want to do, the restaurants you have reservations for, and events with reservations per day. That way you don't feel like you're following a ""list"" and need to be on time or rushed. Exploring and finding hidden gems are half the fun!

I am a big foodie person and I'm only making 2 reservation, 1 for dine dining omakase and a nice a5 wagyu restaurant. I'm trusting that japan has amazing food I won't be disappointed (especially coming from the US quality). I'll basically be using tabelog and walking around choosing with my eyeballs.

For my itinerary in November, I am doing a half day in Nara!! I don't see why you couldn't fit Uji if it's not too much. I only really wanted to see the temples and the more off the beaten path stops personally in Nara. 

For the shibuya /shinjuku, is the harry hedgehog cafe needing a reservation? I wouldnt put set times for anything unless it's a reservation. Like the shubuya sky is the only thing you'd need to be timely for and the rest try to get to and see how you feel as you go.

Basically my advice (again as an extreme overplanner), don't speed run japan. Allow yourself wiggle room and time to rest or anything because you never know what happens.",,,,

I've left out a few Shrines (Which are best to do?) and I'm not too sold on Arashiyama to be honest. I'm sure I'm missing some big pop culture or museum activities, big fan of anime and video games as well! Obviously can't book anything now though. Also love Art and Design too, anything that scratches those itches would be appreciated!

* Planning to do Temple Goshuincho, starting with Koyasan, any tips or etiquette to follow?
* Do stuff in Koyasan until 1pm or so, then come back to Osaka in afternoon, explore Umeda shopping or more Dotonbori. (Maybe go to Pokemon Center etc.)

* Explore other parts of Osaka, like Nipponbashi, DenDen Town, Shinsekai, Tennoji Park etc. for the rest of the day.
* Going to Kyoto: Taking the Hanku-Kyoto line from Osaka-Umeda at 6pm directly to Kyoto-Kawaramachi Station, as our hotel is in the Gion Area.
* Explore Gion after Hotel check in at night.

* Nara Deer Park for the day, maybe to up go Wakakusayama Hill?
* Explore Kyoto in the afternoon.

**Day 5 - Kyoto**

* Fushimi Inari Taisha early in the morning, easy 20min train ride as we are close to Gion-Shijo Station.
* Go to Mt Kurama later in the day for a mountainside temple and away from the crowds.

**Day 6 - Kyoto**

* Saihoji Temple Reservation in Kyoto at 10:30am.
* ?? Another free slot, no idea what to do after this temple

Thank you!",https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1fhnytk/itinerary_train_travel_check_3_week/,"I think you're trying too hard to make a pass work. It doesn't look as even one Setouchi Area Pass would be better than buying everything separately. The closer you would get would be starting in day... 9 so you have the shinkansen from Hiroshima to Kyoto on day 14. But you'd still have to get a ticket for the shinkansen from there to Tokyo.

You're probably better off buying separate tickets as you go. Also, check the flights from Hiroshima to Tokyo (Haneda). Between going to and from the airports the journey can last the same as the shinkansen, but it's probably cheaper.",,,,
1fhi6os,Itinerary Advice for two week first trip please!,"My partner and I have booked our flights for our first trip to Japan - yay! Arriving 12th May and departing 27th May 2025.

We haven‚Äôt booked our accommodation yet. We‚Äôre hoping to sense-check our itinerary first, if anyone would be kind enough to take a look? We‚Äôd like to prioritise a better experience over being cost-conscious. We‚Äôre planning to buy a lot of cute things and alternative clothes, so we‚Äôre trying to keep a lot of time open for shopping. And we‚Äôre imagining that we should be flexible about which day we do what in Tokyo, so we can use the least cloudy day to hopefully see Mt Fuji.



**Day 1 - Tokyo**

Arrive by Narita airport

Stay in Tokyo (in Minato, Asakusa or Roppongi?)

- Shibuya crossing

- Ikebukuro



**Days 6-8 - Kyoto**

Shinkansen from Tokyo to Kyoto

Hotel in Kyoto, one of these:

- Downtown Kyoto (easiest to access)

- Higashiyama (very traditional)

- Kyoto Station Area (good for travelling around)



- early morning: Arashiyama Bamboo Grove

- Fushimi Inari Taisha

- Geisha districts Higashiyama and Gion

- Kinkaku-ji Temple?

- have Pontocho



**Day 9 - Osaka**

Shinkansen to Osaka

Kobe day trip?

",https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1fhi6os/itinerary_advice_for_two_week_first_trip_please/,"Day 3- It's not advisable to shop at Nakamise St. They have plenty of crap souvenirs that are kinda expensive and it's overflowing with people. You can get the same or better stuff and a better experience basically anywhere else. Try to go to Senso-ji before everything opens so you don't waste your time and can admire the temple, which is the important thing there.

Day 4- I'd be a waste if you went to Hakone and didn't go to the lake and temple. There's only so much time you can spend at an onsen. Also, check the Hakone Freepass.

Day 5- Kawaguchiko is a full day trip. If you put Ikebukuro there for dinner or checking the neighborhood at night, it's fine. If you plan to shop, you won't have time.

Day 9- You don't use the shinkansen to get from Kyoto to Osaka, you just take a normal train.

Day 12- a 1 day trip to Okinawa doesn't make any sense.",One day in Ishigaki is a waste in time both getting there and not being able to enjoy it.,[These guidebooks](https://www.gotokyo.org/book/en/list/) might be useful when planning.,,
1fhh0ad,"Itinerary check Tsuruga, Utsenomia, Ishikawa, and of course Tokyo","We are planning on traveling to Tsuruga, Fukui in December. We have never been there and while we are visiting a friend was wondering what we might do. Anyone have experience in Tsuruga now that the Shinkansen has been extended?

Tokyo arrival, staying near Shinigawa station, will do the perfunctory Udon, Sushi, and Tempura. Then will take the Shinkansen to Utsinomia and visit Moka and Mashiklo (we love to pick up kitchen pottery there). Mashiko has a pottery class where you make your own pottery, it takes weeks to dry, finish, and kiln so it really isn‚Äôt an activity to do once and be done. But, it is a blast. They do have plenty of items for sale if you can't stick around to make your own.

As the family owns a restaurant that is busy during New Years we will leave for Ishikawa. Have found a decent hotel off the main highway that we will probably reuse. Will do a tour of the local sake breweries to see if I can find something that is importable. Yah, navigating import export laws for alcohol is hell‚Ä¶

But with the extension of the Shinkansen to Tsuruga we are wondering if anyone has thoughts on places to visit and experience. We are planning on going to the fish market. I also want to visit the port as there is a route from the Tsuruga port to port of Seattle. We are planning on visiting the Port of Humanity Tsuruga Museum to check out its WWII immigration history.

I have visited the Kanazawa castle garden numerous times, so am interested in visiting the Kehi-no-Matsubara garden to see how that compares.

But again, not seeing much in the way of food, or hotels with kitchens, any thoughts?

After Utsenomia, we will Shinkansen back to Tokyo for a couple days, probably in the Tokyo Station area.",https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1fhh0ad/itinerary_check_tsuruga_utsenomia_ishikawa_and_of/,"If you check the map, you'll see that when traveling to Mashiko by train, it's usually better to skip going all the way to Utsunomiya. Instead, transfer at Oyama to the Mito Line, go to Shimodate, and then take the Moka Railway from there. You can also take the Shinkansen from Tokyo to Oyama, but whether you take it or not, the arrival time will be the same. It takes about three hours from Shinagawa to Mashiko. There is also a bus from Utsunomiya to Mashiko, but it only runs three times in the morning on weekdays and once on weekends.
However, if you want to arrive in Mashiko early, you might consider staying overnight in Utsunomiya and taking the bus the next day, or staying in Oyama and taking the train. Alternatively, you could spend the day sightseeing in Tokyo and head to Utsunomiya or Oyama in the evening. Another option is to visit Nikko during the day and stay in Utsunomiya without returning to Tokyo, or visit Ashikaga Flower Park and stay in Oyama.","> there is a route from the Tsuruga port to port of Seattle.

1fgpcs8,First time in Japan / Nov 2024 Itinerary - 16/11 to 29/11,"Hi all,  
Currently planning a trip to Japan from 16th to 29th Nov. Mandatory stops will be Tokyo, Osaka, Kyoto and Nara. 

Was contemplating then adding Okinawa or  Hiroshima or  Fukuoka. While still very crude, the main idea is below. I feel it's too heavily based on Osaka, but has the advantage of allowing the trip back being from a main airport and have a central base instead of moving hotels constantly.

Open to suggestions !

\* \* \* \* \*

***Tokyo:***  
16/11/2024 - Flight to Tokyo arriving mid afternoon. Go to the hotel. Explore Shibuya Crossing, Hachiko Statue, Shibuya Center-Gai Shopping Street. Eat in the area

22/11/2024 - Kinkakuji (Golden Pavilion) Temple (morning), Adashino Nenbutsuji (instead of Bamboo Forest / Arashiyama, Monkey Park Iwatayama

You could make a stop at himeji and either put your luggage at a coin locket at the train station or send it forward through a luggage forwarding service the night before. Then you could continue to Hiroshima, check-in and do the memorial park/museum and dome, btw at night it‚Äôs very nice and peaceful. Then plan a whole day for miyajima island, i did too and it was so worth it, we didn‚Äôt habe to stress or worry about anything. Then your flight back is from osaka so either go directly to somewhere near the airport and explore the place there or stay in osaka and do some last minute shopping. Hope this helps and have a nice trip :)","Tokyo Tower and the Skytree are in the east end of the city, and it looks like you're staying around Shibuya in the west end, based on your arrival day itinerary. Might I suggest the City Hall Observation Deck in Shinjuku? It has some great views, is closer to what you're seeing that day and is completely free. 

You have the same issue with Tsukiji (in the east end). If you moved it to day 3 with all the other attractions in the east, you will have much less travelling time overall.

Meiji Shrine is incredibly overrated, and since you're headed to Kyoto, you will see much nicer temples there. Senso-ji alone blows Meiji out of the water, IMO.

Edit: OOOH I just saw you have Adashino Nenbutsu-ji on your itinerary. I think this is the first time I've seen this. This is a great way to fight crowds, because it's so far away from the main tourist centres. This is a great pick. I loved this place. It's haunting.

Someone else commented on your Hiroshima day being WAY too much, and I agree. You should probably choose one or the other, because both Hiroshima and Miyajima in one day isn't going to happen.",

Then going from there to kiyomizu dera is again about an hour by public transport. What i did when i was in kyoto and had no time was renting a bike. I was more flexible and really enjoyed the scenery. Could recommend ‚ÄûMori Bicycle Shop‚Äú. We rented two electric bikes for a very reasonable price and Mori-San was very nice and helpful.

Would change Kuromon market to [Kizu Market](https://maps.app.goo.gl/vQ2pVFarVAXzkoMi6?g_st=com.google.maps.preview.copy), more local and less a tourist place.

[Kirinji Osaka Sohonten](https://maps.app.goo.gl/hajsGTNLYrEqJ1oW9?g_st=com.google.maps.preview.copy) a very good mazesoba in Denden town

Dotombori is a bit overrated, worth the picture but the shops are chained brands that you can find in other places.

Would give Nara a lot more time if you can, there are a few shopping streets that are full of traditional stores.

[Nara toy museum](https://maps.app.goo.gl/NH6GwbXjzobrDNgh6?g_st=com.google.maps.preview.copy) small museum of old toys, interactive and staff knows English

[Naramachi Lattice house](https://maps.app.goo.gl/B6aYfwAjAy9mpUHi6?g_st=com.google.maps.preview.copy) old house that you can go inside, staff knows english.

[Shiga Naoya‚Äôs Old Residence](https://maps.app.goo.gl/5fFDee8Kt95BsAqu6?g_st=com.google.maps.preview.copy) the house of a very famous writer in Japan

In Uji

[Byodo-in](https://maps.app.goo.gl/6owWjzLNUfANmLCq7?g_st=com.google.maps.preview.copy) gorgeous buddhist temple

DO NOT go to [Itoh Kyuemon](https://maps.app.goo.gl/xWgwUoyQkhcrmwi87?g_st=com.google.maps.preview.copy), absolute tourist trap, foods only for photo and taste bad

You are doing the Hakone express visit, so you're time is going to be very limited at each venue. Hakone is best visited over a few days. 

1. Most restaurants here close early. Be sure to be mindful of your time. 

2. Hakone Shrine Tori Gate - Get there very early. If you arrive in the early afternoon or later, there will be a line of tourists waiting to take a photo at the Tori gate on the water, sometimes over an hour wait. 

3. Gora doesn't have a lot of kombinis; you may want to stop at one in Yumoto to stock up on some snacks. 

4. I would also check out the Amazake Tea House. It has been owned by the same family for many generations, and the building is beautiful!",,,
1fdtkbb,"9 day road trip in Hokkaido, itinerary check?","Hi all, I've got a very last minute opportunity to take 9 days (!!) of time off in Hokkaido end Sept/early Oct came up before I need to be elsewhere in Japan for work, so am trying to work out what makes sense. 

This would be my first time, I'd love to drive around and catch any autumn foliage that's already out but most of the road trip itineraries I've seen took about two weeks and focused on the South and West -- I'm quite curious about the North-East.  I'm considering the following, any advice, suggestions, guidance, mockery about being overambitious gratefully etc received. Would prefer to see wild landscapes over visiting built-up areas.

- Day 1: flight into New Chitose, connect into Nakashibetsu or Memanbetsu and rent a car there. Visit Akan Mashu/Kaminokoike, sleep there

- Day 2: Shiretoko Nat'l Park, whale cruise, sleep near Rausu

- Day 3: Lake Abashiri, Meruhen-no-oka then drive inland to Kinsenkyo Gorge, sleep in Takinoue?

- Day 4: Drive up to Wakkanai and explore the cape, sleep there

- Day 5: Ferry to Rishiri Island, Toyosaki Kompira shrine, sleep partway down the coast (maybe Haboro?) 

- Day 6: Drive down to Asahi-dake, explore and see Blue Pond etc, sleep locally e.g. Asahikawa? 

- Day 7: Drive to Sapporo, explore

- Day 8: Otaru and maybe Yoichi, as day trip from Sapporo

- Day 9: Noboribetsu, sleep locally?

- Day 10: Drop off car, departure from Sapporo

Any thoughts? Conscious I'm missing Hakodate, not sure if you would consider that a fair trade. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1fdtkbb/9_day_road_trip_in_hokkaido_itinerary_check/,"It seems a cool trip!


I was there in May, here are my 2 cents, I hope it will help you!



I assume you already drove in japan since you work here. If not, I would advice to do your research about it (driving left, signs, licences, rules...).


I have no idea to what the weather will be like. Hokkaido is very north so I guess snow and ice come back quickly, especially at the north. Check carefully road conditions but maybe it is a useless warning in late september. I Just prefer to say so because in early may, I was surprised with how much I needed to check it. 


In general, your path seems feasable but dense. Not necessarily a bad thing, I like to travel at a relatively fast pace too (less than you however). Just so you know. You can still adjust once you are here to do less.



I went in car from Date to Kushiro, Nemuro, Shiretoko and finish in Asahikawa. Used train to Sapporo and Otaru.
The express way to go accross the island was the most boring part of my trip. I like to drive but the 70km/h and the number of tunnels made it not really fun (no landscapes to watch...). So I think you have a really good idea to connect by plane or train to a place where it will be more enjoyable to drive.



Concerning the days where i can have an input :


Day 2 : good choice, i loved it. I couldnt do the whale cruise because of the weather but still had a blast visiting. Here is a link I got at my Hotel I wish I knew before to help to prepare :  https://center.shiretoko.or.jp/i-box/english.html


Days 7 to 10 : maybe the car is not that much usefull for these parts and trains could do the work just as good. 

The way you speak about it, maybe spending one less day here and one more in the north or the east would be a cool thing to do, to be more relax in the wild part.","I didn't go to Hakodate, will have to be next time. I'd like to put in a vote for Lake Kussharo if you can swing by it - it's spectacularly beautiful.",,,

You clearly like shopping, so you should go to Tenjinbashisuji in Osaka, the longest shopping street in Japan (2.6km).

If you want a castle, you should skip Osaka's and go to Himeji castle since it's one of the 12 originals left in Japan. The interior of Osaka castle is a somewhat disappointing modern-looking museum.",,,,
1fd1u51,Itinerary check: 8 days in April (rough draft!) ,"Hi ‚Äì we are planning to take our family of 5 (kids ages 4, 7, 9) to Japan next April. I hope to iterate on and flesh out my itinerary over time as I read through guidebooks, but was hoping to get some thoughts on my basic outlook. My hope is not to get overly ambitious with filling every minute of our time. Aside from a few attractions like TeamLab Planets and possibly a baseball game, I hope to focus on 1-2 neighborhoods each day and let my wife and kids pick from an open-ended set of options (rather than stick to a set agenda). ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†

Any thoughts or criticisms (or additions/deletions) would be much appreciated. Apologies in advance for any mistakes and dumb questions.

¬†

**Open items**:

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† **Mobile service**: We use T-Mobile. Reddit searches indicate that int‚Äôl roaming is reasonably reliable throughout Japan, but curious if anyone disagrees.

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† **NEX vs Limousine Bus**: We‚Äôll be flying into Narita and heading to the Conrad first. Our kids have gotten better over time at handling their own luggage, but the idea of switching trains with all our luggage gives me pause. Or perhaps it makes more sense to ship our luggage and take 1-2 carry-ons on the train.

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† **Kyoto**: Is 1 night too ambitious? We could either expand to 2 nights (downside is we‚Äôd only have one night in Tokyo before returning to Narita) or save Kyoto for our next visit. We could alternatively do Disney for 1 day/night.

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† **2****^(nd)** **Tokyo leg / Asakusa**: The 5 nights in Shiodome is locked in, but we could stay anywhere for our 2nd leg in Tokyo. Asakusa is a placeholder. But, we have family friends in Taito-Ku, and Asakusa seems reasonable close.

1fcwzrq,"14 Days in Tokyo, Kyoto, and a few day trips (solo)","Obligatory itinerary review here.

I booked my flight last March and have been tinkering ever since. I've added ideas, removed travel, expanded days, contracted time, and everything in between. I'd originally had plans to hit Nagano, Kanazawa, Takayama, and possibly Fuji, in addition to the main two cities. It just seemed like short changing myself and the destinations to treat tham like layovers. At the end of the day I settled on two main locations with some day trips added. I felt like some of my other days were being lost to travel and wanted to have a more focused vacation. 

In general, I'm much less of a ""here is exactly how my trip will occur person,"" and more of a ""here's a bunch of cool stuff, let me figure out the best order to do it in.""

I really enjoy coffee and do have a bunch of coffee places I want to hit. Recommendations would be great as well. Food not so much. I really love ramen and sushi (but do have some food allergies here). I also am a big pizza person and have seen some cool spots. I'm not a ""I have to eat here and will spend an hour in line or make reservations"" person though. Big whiskey fan so would love to hit some spots for that. I have some bars in Shinjuku and Osaka on my list. Was not able to get tour tickets at either of the Suntory owned spots. Also a really big movie person and would love any recs for things related to Ozu or Kurosawa.

Anyway, here's what I have:

**9/21 - Washington DC to Haneda, landing mid-afternoon**

* Set up e-sim/buy portable Wifi, set up iPhone Suica and possibly buy card, get cash
* Take train to Tokyo station, walk to hotel in Ginza
* Check-in, explore area around hotel, find food, stay up late enough, bed

**9/22 - Coffee, Teamlabs, Ueno/Akhibara**

* Walk to Kyosumi Gardens and explore/try one of amazing coffee shops. Would love to do the tasting at Koffee Mameya Kakeru
* Walk to Koto City and get ready for Teamlab Planets (not necessarily sold on this in general, but thought one of the TeamLab spots would be cool. Should I sub this with another museum?)
* Go back to hotel to chill. Lunch at Terzo for pizza?
* End day Ueno/Akhibara for camera shopping, coffee at Kielo or Kissaten. Food and/or drink recs? 

**9/23 - Kamakura, Yokohama**

* Hit Glitch in the morning
* Train to Kamakura to explore all that it has to offer
* Afternoon baseball game between DeNA and Yakult
* Explore Yokohama a bit if time and feel up to it
* Back to Tokyo for dinner and snoozing

**9/24 - Harajuku and Shibuya**

* Meiji Shrine first thing, coffee before or after
* Explore Harajuku
* Grab lunch and eat in/explore Yoyogi Park
* Explore Shibuya after Chatei Hato Espresso
* Find some too expensive jeans I don't need. Do some shopping and wandering.
* Dinner and drinks in Shibuya

**9/25 - Hike/Day Trip**

* Mt. Takao, Mt Odake or something else in the morning. Can I combine this with a day trip to Kawagoe or something?  Is there somewhere else I can go for the morning that feels a bit outside of the city?
* Back to hotel to change/break 
* Roppongi/Shibuya/Shinjuku for the evening.

**9/26 - Asakusa/Shinjuku**

* Start day at Senso-ji, check out Nakamise-dori
* Explore area
* Back to hotel for lunch 
* Train to Shinjuku to explore/shop
* Brilliant or Zoetrope for whiskey in Shinjuku
* Food?

**9/27 - Train to Kyoto**

* Stop in Hakone or Izu Peninsula
* Suggestions on which one of the above to do on this day. Is Izu feasible? I'm going to try to stop at one or the other on the way back to Tokyo from Kyoto. Seems like maybe Izu is the right move today, being less time constrained?
* Arrive at Kyoto Station, cab or walk to Shimogyo for hotel, just across from Gion.
* Explore area around hotel, explore Gion a bit, nothing too exciting. Find dinner.

**9/28 - East Kyoto**

* Fushimi-Inari 
* Kenninji-Temple & Yasaka Pagoda 
* Gion or maybe Philosopher's Path, depending on 9/28 day
* Back to hotel 
* Nishiki Market, central Kyoto
* Pontocho food and drinks 

**9/29 - Nara/Osaka**

* Train to Nara first thing in the morning 
* Visit Kofuku-ji 
* Visit Todai-ji 
* Deer park, explore 
* Osaka in afternoon, Osaka Castle, explore as much as I can

**9/30 - Extra Kyoto**

* Visit Arabica or Kurasu for morning coffee
* Kibune for a quick trip?
* Back to hotel to I'm sure crash for a bit.
* Bus/train to Uji.
* Back to hotel to break and find dinner in Gion or Pontocho

**10/1 - Himeji Castle, Hikone, Kobe and/or Osaka**

* Train to Himeji Castle 
* Mt Shosha or Himeji Castle in the morning, then other afterewards
* Koko-en Garden 
* Train back... stop in Kobe or Osaka on the way back? Worth it to add a half day in Kobe, or sneak in some more of Osaka? 
* Is it feasible to stop at Yamazaki on the way back?

**10/2 - West Kyoto**

* Bamboo Forest first thing 
* Tenryo-ji 
* Monkey Park 
* Jojakkoji 
* Saga-Toriimoto 
* Back to hotel, open afternoon/evening to try to figure out my life and bags and get ready to depart

**10/3 - Train back to Haneda**

* Stop in Hakone to explore for a bit 
* Stay in Shinagawa or one of the Haneda airport hotels (any recs or preferences?)

**10/4 - Fly out of Haneda 10:00 am**

* Assume I should be to the airport by 7:00 or so? 

  
A lot of this is intentionally vague as I like to explore a bit. I like to have a general outline and then update as needed. If there are any things that sorely stick out I'm missing, please let me know. Anything I should do or add as I'm going, or swap with other days if more things make sense together?",https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1fcwzrq/14_days_in_tokyo_kyoto_and_a_few_day_trips_solo/,"Seems pretty reasonable! You've picked great places to visit. Some notes:

* Kamakura is known for its cute caf√©s and has tons of sights to see. It sounds like you only plan to spend a few hours there? Well, I don't know how late your afternoon plans are, but I'd consider visiting Kamakura and Yokohama on different days so you aren't stretched for time. It's not that much longer in transit.
* Personally, I wouldn't do either Hakone or the Izu Peninsula as a ""stopover"" between Tokyo and Kyoto. The Izu Peninsula is spread out and takes a while to get around by public transit, so you can't see much in one day. Hakone is much more viable as a day trip. That said, it's also spread out and full of stuff to do, so it'll be a *long* day. Keep in mind that even though both are geographically ""between"" Tokyo and Kyoto, the fastest trains between Tokyo and Kyoto don't stop there, so it'll add more time to your journey than you might expect based on the distance. Most people stopping in these locations between Tokyo and Kyoto stay overnight. This is what I'd recommend. Plus you can stay in a ryokan with onsen, which is one of the big appeals of these two destinations.
* There is a chain called ""Liquor Museum"" that's all over and has a wide selection of Japanese whiskey. Easy to get into, worth checking out.","* Take train to Tokyo station, walk to hotel in Ginza

No. From Haneda it make no sense to go to Tokyo station first. Take the Keikyu line that turn into the Asakusa line and stop a Higashi Ginza station.

* Walk to Koto City and get ready for Teamlab Planets (not necessarily sold on this in general, but thought one of the TeamLab spots would be cool. Should I sub this with another museum?)

Went to teamlab in Fukuoka and liked it, so I am not against teamLab exhibit. However, you might want to buy ticket in advance as it can sell out a couple of days to a week in advance.

* Mt. Takao, Mt Odake or something else in the morning. Can I combine this with a day trip to Kawagoe or something? Is there somewhere else I can go for the morning that feels a bit outside of the city?

Takao + Kawagoe... nah that's a bit far, not sure it's even really convenient to move between the two.

* Suggestions on which one of the above to do on this day. Is Izu feasible? I'm going to try to stop at one or the other on the way back to Tokyo from Kyoto. Seems like maybe Izu is the right move today, being less time constrained?

Hakone is not to difficult to do as a stop. Izu... depend, the peninsula is big and kind of depend on where exactly you want to go. Do not know about the frequency of the bus either. Honestly the best thing to do would be to check public transport schedule for what you want to see and check if it make sense.

* Deer park, explore

Nara Park.

* Kibune for a quick trip?

Check the distance from your hotel... that does not sound like a ""quick trip"".

* Is it feasible to stop at Yamazaki on the way back?

You mean the whiskey distillery. Considering it close before 5pm and you need a reservation... no. Himeji and Mount Shosha hike will already take most of the day.",,,
1fcuztv,Itinerary Check for this (Most likely Early-Mid) October.,"\*Just a bit of a disclaimer, I don't know exactly how many days I will be able to stay, depends on work and flight loads to and from. (So if there are any day trips I could take with an extra day or two please let me know!)

Finally get to go back to Japan after a long time waiting. This trip is a bit spontaneous so I'm not really trying to make it crazy efficient, just want to hit a couple must see places and have fun.

1favngo,"Itinerary Check: 11 days in Tokyo, Nara, Kanazawa, & Hiroshima in mid-October","Hey everyone - looking for advice & tips on my solo itinerary in about a month. This will be my second time in Japan, but first time solo traveling - I visited Tokyo / Kyoto / Osaka early last year, and looking to explore some other cities (but still hitting Tokyo because... Tokyo). Would especially love to hear:

* How is my pacing? I like to stay relatively busy, but not totally exhausted. I'm a big fan of visiting restaurants more than anything, can still appreciate sightseeing though. This time around, I'm hoping to buy some cool items, especially table/kitchenware and useful products in Japan.
* Should I go to Kanazawa before Nara, or after? Either way the route looks a little out of the way - the stay at Hiroshima is set in stone, so there's less flexibility with Hiroshima
* Any big attractions / must-dos that I'm missing, especially in the non-Tokyo cities? In Tokyo, I've already been to some of the classic tourist spots (teamLab Planets, Imperial Palace, etc.).
* How does solo traveling differ from a usual trip? Anything I should keep in mind?

1fastun,Kyoto 3 day Itinerary ,"I'm heading to Japan next week and couldn't be more excited! I'll be starting in Tokyo for 5 days, then heading to the Kyoto/Osaka area for 3 days before flying to Amami Island from Osaka on the 4th day. I'm debating whether to stay in one city and take day trips to the other or split my accommodations‚Äîmaybe a couple of nights in one city and one night in the other.

Here's my rough itinerary so far, starting either the evening before or the morning of the first day:

**Day 1:**

* Likely getting to hotel around 9-10am form Tokyo then heading Kinkakuji
* Kibune
* Kokedera

**Day 2:**

* Fushimi Inari Shrine (EARLY, around 5-7 AM)
* Daigoji Temple
* Tofukuji Temple
* Toji Temple
* End the day with food and drinks in the Fushimi Sake District

**Day 3:**

* Kiyomizudera Temple
* Possibly check out of my place in Kyoto and move to a hotel in Osaka
* Visit Himeji Castle
* Return to Osaka to explore the city and enjoy food and drinks before my flight the next day

This is still flexible, and I'd love any feedback on whether it's feasible or if I should rearrange, add spots, or change anything. TYIA!",https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1fastun/kyoto_3_day_itinerary/,Day 3 is too much. Himeji is a solid day and you want to get there early,,,,
1farnbg,Question about Flights,"This is only my second time traveling internationally so please forgive me if this is a stupid question.
We‚Äôre planning a two week trip to Japan next year. The plan was to arrive in Osaka and make stops in Kyoto and Nara before traveling to Tokyo and ending our trip there. So our current plan is to fly one-way into Kansai International Airport and then fly back out of Narita (one-way). Is this a terrible idea?

1f9gbw1,Lighters after security? (leaving tokyo),"so last time i was leaving tokyo i noticed there was this glass box where many people were throwing their lighters in so i assumed lighters were not allowed after security and ended up doing the same, later while i was looking around i noticed smoking areas which i assumed would be only for vape/heated tobacco but i was wrong and saw many people smoking regular tabaco and using lighters, does that mean that you can pass lighters throught security?

i know for a fact they didnt buy them in one of the stores because i asked in many of them and they all said no lighters were sold after security",https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1f9gbw1/lighters_after_security_leaving_tokyo/,If I'm not mistaken you can bring some types of lighters as a carry on but lighters cannot be in your checked baggage. So you probably saw people throwing away lighters they didn't want to carry that they had in their checked baggage.,,,,
1nae4ed,Just had the worst food tour experience in Kyoto,"Just had the worst food tour experience yesterday on Sep 6 in Kyoto. Not only did I feel scammed, the entire evening was wasted as I dealt with the situation. Now, the company has provided a full refund, but I still want to rant a bit and get your opinions on whether this is a genuine mistake as they claimed. Or perhaps I‚Äôm an AH and this is actually a normal experience. 

TLDR: $90 per person food tour in Kyoto, only got 7 ‚Äúdishes‚Äù when the website advertised 13. Food cost was estimated to be $25-30. We also had to fight over platters of food of varying value. Supposedly, each eating a different kind of sushi and tempura makes it a diversifying experience. I felt like a beggar eating at the table. 

The evening started off at Yakitori Torikizoku. This already raised some red flag for me right away. When my friend introduced this restaurant to me a few years ago, I was told that this was a popular but cheap/ affordable Yakitori restaurants frequented by high school/ college kids. I thought this restaurant choice was ok but didn‚Äôt really meet the expectation of a unique local only sort of experience. We each ordered a drink, and the guide ordered a beer instead of a fruity drink my brother wanted. We had to ask him to reorder the correct drink. We then each got a chicken skewer, a piece of wing, a piece of Namba chicken, and a few bites of rice. I would estimate this to cost around $10 pp. 

The tour guide then took us walking to a temple near by. He dashed away quickly as the next restaurant was about to be closed. He brought us pork katsu which admittedly is probably one of the best I have had. We each got a skewer of it, which I estimate to be around $5. We ate at the temple but I wonder whether we were meant to eat at the restaurant? 

We spent some time taking pictures at the temple and learning some basic Japanese/ Kyoto history. 

The tour ended at a restaurant called Sugidama which is an izakaya. Now, at this point I was expecting many more dishes of much larger quantity. This is especially when we literally only each got a few bites per ‚Äúdish‚Äù thus far. I thought this would be the grand finale. We each got a drink. They then ordered a platter of tempura (2 ebi, 2 fish, 2 eggplants, and 2 yam) and a platter of sushi (7 pieces each with different kinds of fish, e.g., tuna, salmon, ebi, yellowtail‚Ä¶). We were then asked to divide them amongst the 7 of us. This was EXTREMELY awkward and uncomfortable. I felt like a beggar sitting there. Wouldn‚Äôt it be obvious that everyone wants the seafood tempura over the veggie? I assume the sushi‚Äôs are of similar value otherwise. The tour guide then went on to say this is to give us an opportunity to experience as much as possible, as if we shared the same mouth. I estimate this stop to cost around $5-10. 

To summarize, I ate one chicken skewer, a piece of namba chicken (3 bites), a chicken wing, a small bowl of rice, a pork katsu skewer, a piece of sushi, a yam tempura, and 2 drinks. 

When I tried to clarify with the guide at the end where the number 13 dishes is coming from, he claimed that there were actually 15. I was just dumbfounded at that point and didn‚Äôt push it further. 

After the tour, we contacted the business. To our pleasant surprise, they quickly apologized for the experience, stating that the guide was new to hosting such a big group and miscalculated the food portion. I wanted to give them the benefit of the doubt but it just felt impossible for someone to think this portion and value of food is appropriate for the cost of the tour. Nonetheless, the offered a full refund. 

Unfortunately, I can‚Äôt attach any picture as proof to this subreddit. But they messaged me and apologized deeply. Also explained how they would prevent this from happening again.

I‚Äôm curious to hear everyone‚Äôs thought: 
1. Is this a normal food tour experience? 
2. Do you think I‚Äôm overreacting?
3. Do you think this was a genuine mistake?

Is it even a licensed tour run by locals?","If any food ""guide"" took me to Torikizoku, the chain, I would laugh and leave without paying any money to this sham.  They might as well taken you all to McDonald's for an appetiser.",
1n18ovb,two weeks in japan,"my boyfriend and I just spent two weeks (12 full days of exploration, considering the travel time) in tokyo and osaka. we also did a day trip to kyoto, which was lovely. after visiting, i wanted to post about my experiences in hopes of providing some insight for those of you looking to travel to japan in the future! at the end of the post, i‚Äôll include a day-to-day itinerary of our adventures. we did minimal planning, just general cultural research in preparation. 

we stayed at the hotel metropolitan edmont in iidabashi in tokyo. this hotel was downright lovely. it was affordable, but so nice. iidabashi is a super quiet neighborhood, so if you‚Äôre looking to be in the middle of the action, i don‚Äôt recommend, but it suited us well. lots of eateries and train stations close by. we were more central in osaka, at the luxcare hotel in tenmabashi. definitely a different vibe from our tokyo hotel, but still good. the location was super convenient overall. 

we took the metro absolutely everywhere. for context, i lived in nyc and have used the metro in various american and european cities, so i felt very confident navigating. the tokyo metro was a breeze imo. super intuitive and easy to use. a suica card is a MUST! it will get you everywhere you need to go - don‚Äôt even consider paying for another pass, IC covers it all. the osaka metro was a bit more confusing for us. i think it came down to signage and odd station layouts, but we always figured it out in the end. 

it was obviously super hot, as our visit was mid-late august. i do not recommend visiting this time of year, i‚Äôll be honest. we made do - we‚Äôre from north carolina so the weather just felt like home, but we spent many afternoon hours in our hotel room and found ourselves ducking into stores to find a respite from the heat. an umbrella, fan, and lots of water are non-negotiables. if you do visit in the summer, rely on museums and other indoor activities to save yourself from the relentless sun, take afternoon siestas, and go out at night. 

we did do a day trip in kyoto, and if i were to change one thing, it would be the amount of nights we stayed in osaka. don‚Äôt get me wrong, it was a super interesting and much more diverse city (from what i saw) than tokyo, but 7 nights weren‚Äôt necessary. i maybe would have opted for 5 and done a couple nights in kyoto. as you‚Äôll see in the itinerary below, we did all the main tourist spots. this was our first visit and they felt obligatory. the next time we visit, we‚Äôll hit smaller, more niche spots. to our credit, we ate at lots of holes in the wall. don‚Äôt shy away from eating at local spots!!! ofc keep an eye out for those rare hostile ‚Äútourists unwelcome‚Äù signs, but in my experience, people are friendly and most restaurants have qr code or tablet ordering. 

there was definitely awkwardness and minor faux pas along the way, especially in restaurant settings - i feel like that‚Äôs to be expected. we occasionally leaned on google translate but overall we were able to communicate without issue, regardless of language barriers. an example of faux pas on our parts: we often like to grab a snack between meals and share something, especially when it‚Äôs a new food item we‚Äôve never tried before. we didn‚Äôt realize until the end of our trip that it‚Äôs considered rude to order one plate for two people. we were corrected by staff and urged to order a second item, and did so without issue. we just didn‚Äôt realize this was a thing! 

a final note on osaka: sooo many more gaijin/tourists than tokyo. i was not expecting this! europeans were around every corner. i also found myself getting lots of more stares in osaka. i didn‚Äôt once notice anyone staring at me in tokyo, but almost from the get-go, i clocked it in osaka. i don‚Äôt care to read into why they were staring or what the social context is, i just observed this as a difference between the two cities. 

general tips: get international phone service for the month of your visit or an esim - it‚Äôs a lifesaver. don‚Äôt get too attached to your plans and account for a rest day / a nap here and there. a suica/ic card is 100% necessary. always carry cash - you may end up using your credit card a lot, but carry it anyway. learn the basic phrases (arigat≈çgozaimasu, sumimasen, gomen nasai) - they will take you far. look up restaurant etiquette. be mindful of social norms and be quiet in public (there are exceptions like izakayas, but i‚Äôm talking about public transit and the average restaurant). 

day 1 - 7-11 and jet lag. we landed around 9 the night before, got our hotel, and tried to sleep, but made the mistake of sleeping on the plane. if you land in the evening, try to stick it out and stay away. i was a mess this day and got actually sick. a mid-afternoon bath rejuvenated me and we ventured back out in the evening for a gyoza dinner. 

day 2 - explored the imperial palace grounds and went to akihabara in the evening. visited the 10-story yodobashi camera and super potato. conveyor belt sushi for dinner. 

day 3 - shibuya - record shopping, many stores, and the hachiko statue. shinjuku - kabukicho and golden gai. we went into an empty bar on a corner with no cover charge and ¬•700 drinks. the man running the place played us guitar and gave me a cigarette. indian for lunch. yakitori for dinner. 

day 4 - senso-ji temple and karaoke. dinner at an izakaya. 

day 5 - last day in tokyo. back to shinjuku. art museum, views from the government building, and a rest in chuo park. korea town and a lovely bonchon dinner. thrifting in harajuku. 

day 6 - fly to osaka (we probably could have taken a bus or train, but oh well, this worked for us). pizza and a shoeless smoke-friendly izakaya. 

day 7 - universal studios. 

day 8 - osaka castle (but i lowkey overheated so we didn‚Äôt stick around long). dontonbori. takoyaki and okonamiyaki for dinner. drinks and cigs by the water. 

day 9 - kyoto. temples, views, markets. sushi and green tea ice cream for lunch. burger king for dinner LOL. 

day 10 - history museum. beef bowls, unagi, and natto for lunch. shinsekai - rainy and so hot / humid i almost crashed out. sichuan noodles and a shared kebab for dinner. 

day 11 - private hot spring at an onsen (this ran us ¬•7,200. pricier than a normal onsen, but i have tattoos and we didn‚Äôt want to be separated for the experience). yakiniku for lunch. izakaya hopping in the evening. 

day 12 - last day. taiwanese breakfast. kaiyukan, ferris wheel, more okonomiyaki. early night and home the next day!  

if you want any specifics or recommendations, feel free to ask in the comments! the post was long enough so i limited myself lol.

1n44w0g,"Spent the night in a 1,400-year-old temple in Nagano ‚Äì here‚Äôs what it was like to stay in a shukubo at Zenkoji","During my solo trip to Nagano, I had the chance to stay at a shukubo (temple lodging) right next to Zenkoji, one of Japan‚Äôs most historically significant Buddhist temples ‚Äì and it turned out to be the highlight of my entire trip.

About Zenkoji

Zenkoji Temple was founded in the 7th century, making it over 1,400 years old. It‚Äôs considered one of the most important pilgrimage sites in Japan, as it enshrines the first Buddhist statue ever brought into the country.

Uniquely, Zenkoji is not affiliated with any specific Buddhist sect, making it open to everyone ‚Äì regardless of religious background. Millions of visitors come each year to walk its sacred grounds, seek spiritual clarity, or simply experience its powerful presence.

One of its most famous features is the okaidan meguri, a pitch-dark underground passage under the main hall. You walk in complete darkness, searching for a hidden key that symbolizes enlightenment. It‚Äôs surprisingly intense and symbolic.
„ÄÄ
Staying at a Shukubo

Rather than booking a hotel, I opted to stay at one of the shukubo lodgings run by the temple community. It felt like stepping into a different era.

Here‚Äôs what the experience was like:
	‚Ä¢The setting: As I arrived just before sunset, the sound of temple bells echoed through the quiet streets. The air smelled faintly of incense. Everything felt calm, timeless.
	‚Ä¢The room: Tatami mats, sliding shoji doors, no television or distractions. Minimalist but deeply relaxing.
	‚Ä¢Dinner: I was served shojin ryori (traditional Buddhist vegan cuisine). No meat, no garlic or onions ‚Äì but the flavors were delicate and profound. Honestly, it was one of the best meals I had in Japan.
	‚Ä¢Morning ceremony: At 5:30am, I joined the monks in their morning chanting ritual inside the main hall. The sound of sutras being chanted in unison while candlelight flickered in the background‚Äîit was one of the most moving experiences of my trip.
	‚Ä¢People: The staff (often monks or temple caretakers) were incredibly kind and welcoming. Despite my limited Japanese, they made everything easy and memorable.

Final Thoughts
This wasn‚Äôt just a place to sleep ‚Äì it was a deeply spiritual and peaceful experience.

In the middle of a fast-paced trip, this night felt like hitting pause. I walked away feeling lighter, clearer, and more grounded. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for something more meaningful than just sightseeing.
„ÄÄ
Would you ever stay in a temple like this?
Or have you tried one in another part of Japan?",https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1n44w0g/spent_the_night_in_a_1400yearold_temple_in_nagano/,"This sounds like a very memorable experience. Thank you for sharing. I will add this to my must visit list.

I did Shukubo at Hojo-in in Koyasan, and the experience sounds very similar. Beautiful garden & wonderful Shojin ryori. Breakfast was served while having a chat with and English speaking priest. 

There was an underground passage at another temple, very eerie.","I did a shukubo stay at Eko-in in Koyasan and it was the highlight of my trip as well!! The temple was so peaceful; I got to join in on an Akijan meditation in english, and the monk that brought my dinner was pretty new to the life and a big Ghibli fan; we saw my keychain of Gigi and we ended up chatting for a long time about our favorite movies and anime!

Did a night tour of the cemetery, then the morning prayers and a Gouma fire ritual afterwards! I think everyone should have a shukubo experience somewhere in Japan, it's such a peaceful, fascinating thing to do!","My first shukubo was at a small and very quiet temple in Minobu, a very short walk from Kuon-ji, the head temple for the Nichiren sect. Upon arrival to the temple, we were greeted by the monk and we did a welcoming blessing and greeting/prayer in the temple‚Äôs main hall. If we had arrived earlier we would have been able to participate in suigyo (a purifying ritual where one splashes water onto oneself) but our drive took longer than expected since we were doing a pretty long road trip. I think we arrived around 7:00pm so it was already dark during that time of year. 

Shojin ryori was made for us by the monk‚Äôs wife, and it was so incredibly flavorful. The bath was massive and spotlessly clean. Our futons were like clouds, impossibly fluffy. Best night of sleep I‚Äôve ever had. Woke up at 4:30 am for a before-sunrise walk and tour with our temple‚Äôs monk around the grounds of kuon-ji. Watched the most intense bell-ringing from a student monk at kuon-ji. They basically pull back the rope of the bell so far that they lay flat on the ground. 

Did morning gongyo chants at sunrise and continued our walk around the grounds of kuonji with our monk. Returned to our shukubo temple to rest before another delicious shojin ryori breakfast. Rode the cable car to the top of the mountain and watched mt fuji through the clouds. 

Really lovely experience. I think a lot of people go to koyasan, which is also a great location (I‚Äôve also stayed here overnight via car camping-really fun as well! We met a lot of people on their own pilgrimages who were staying via camper vans and trailers) but I really loved the privateness of our stay in Minobu. It‚Äôs a really beautiful area.",why you using chatgpt,"That sounds amazing. We're going in November and have been trying to get a spot at Eihei-ji, but they seem to not be opening anything after October. Our backup plan is to stay at the hotel affiliated with the monastery and participate in the morning service. For those who don't know, Eihei-ji is the monastery founded in the 1200s by Dogen founder of the Soto school of Zen. The ""sister"" monastery opened by his disciple Keizan, called Soji-Ji, is located in Kamakura, and we plan to tour that one."
1nao8bc,Kanazawa and Takayama Review,"This is my third time going to Japan and I was traveling with extended family who had never been. I remember hating Osaka and Kyoto and finding them very overwhelming so I decided to do Tokyo then 2 days in Kanazawa and 2 days in Takayama. 

Kanazawa and Takayama were amazing. I wish Id spent 3 days in each. Travel wise, because we were a group of 7 with luggage we actually rented a minibus and road tripped for our four days. We essentially got a day and a half in each city. I got very lucky that there was no rain and I even got blue skies for most of the trip. I would not come back at the start of September though. 31 degrees is not ideal for walking.

Having spent 5 days in Tokyo, Kanazawa was a relaxing breath of fresh air and Takayama felt like floating on a giant lily pad in a serene lake.

Kanazawa: 
Day 1 we did museums. Then museums here are all small and take between 30 to 45 minutes to complete. 

Ninja Weapon Museum - Cute. Throwing Shiruken was fun. 

Dolls Museum - Surprisingly fun. 

Yoshiro Architecture Museum - The upper garden/tea room are gorgeous. And if you're into architectural history its probably a lot of fun. It was pleasant and nearby to the other museums so why not. 

Nomura ke Samurai Residence - Such beautiful stunninf gardens. Amazing. Kanazawa samurai town was so beautiful to walk in. You never knew what random garden you would find.

Gelateria Ritorta was so good. I got melon flavour gelato and baci and it was delicious. They do many other intriguing flavours like fig, smoky nut, black sesame? 

I wont comment on food because I have the palate of a 5 year old but Vechio Albero does a sexy sexy seeeeexy margarita. 

The next morning we did Kenrokou En garden. There are no words to describe how truly stunning this park is. It just felt healing for the soul. This park was definitely worth visiting. 

Takayama 

A beautiful walkable samurai town.

Hida Folk Village was stunningly beautiful. Would absolutely recommend visiting. Just walking through the town itself is such a fun experience. We randomly discovered a ninja cafe where we did blowdarts and a ninja VR game. 

The drive between Kanazawa and Takayama was 2 hours. 

We made a pit stop to Kurobe Gorge Railway which as pretty as it was...I wouldn't go again. Its a train that rides for 45 minutes through a gorge past 3 stops,  has a 20 minute break and then makes its way back. The views are in the first 15 minutes of the train ride. The remaining 30 minutes are mid. It was an experience but not one I would recommend trekking out for. 

Wanted to share this for anyone who might benefit from it. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1nao8bc/kanazawa_and_takayama_review/,"Good report, thanks.

I rteally enjoyed Takayama for the difference from other places and Kanazawa for the lower levels of crowds but that may have changed as it has been a while. 

To be fair, Kurobe Gorge Railway was impacted by an earthquake damaging a bridge so it can only offer a stunted experience at \~50% n/a.  Across the damaged bridge there are some great views, walking oportunites (brief and longer) and observation points.",Thank you for the trip report!  We are considering visiting Kanazawa on our next trip and appreciate this information.,There's a great tempura restaurant at the bottom of the hill below Kenroku-en by the loop bus stop. Fukuten it's called.,"I'll give a shout to the ""ninja temple"" in Kanazawa (not the weapon museum). No actual ninjas involved, but the tour was very fun (and it's amazing how they can run something like 8 tour groups in parallel without them intersecting - really shows you what a labyrinth the building is).",
1nbpdtg,Three weeks in Japan - overview and thoughts,"Hi all,
 
My partner and I have just spent three weeks in Japan as first timers (August 9 to September 2) and it was everything I‚Äôd hoped it would be and more. Here is an overview -  
 
We landed in Tokyo and immediately made our way to the Fujinomiya area as we had plans to climb Mount Fuji on the 11th August via the Subashiri trial. Sadly we had to alter our plans as a typhoon came in and it would have just been a dangerous (or at the very least, a very miserable) climb. We had to book a hotel on the hop back in Tokyo but we found one for a very reasonable ¬£155 for two nights. We then did the Shinjuku/Shibuya area and a walking tour which I‚Äôd defo recommend: https://www.airbnb.co.uk/experiences/1162458?viralityEntryPoint=2&s=76 

The host gave us some great restaurant recommendations too.
 
We hit Osaka from August 13 and spent two days at this hotel: https://www.candeohotels.com/en/osaka-tower/. 

It was probably my favourite hotel on the whole trip. The rooftop onsen was beautiful and if you go late, chances are you‚Äôll have it all to yourself. Osaka was definitely one of my favourite stops as I loved the Dotonburi area. Lunch at Tempozan market place was a good shout too, some lovely okonomiyaki!
 
We went to Nara for the day on August 15 and got to see the Festival of lights at Todaji temple in the evening which was very special.
 
Then we travelled to Kyoto where we stayed for three nights at this Airbnb: https://www.airbnb.com/l/dOgObyiq 

The host was lovely and the place was super clean and accommodating. Nishiki market was a great place to explore and try some food. Wasn‚Äôt massively impressed with Pontocho alley but maybe that‚Äôs because it was raining at the time! We hiked the Fushimi Inari Shrine at sunset on one of the days which was amazing. The further up you go, the less people there are, so don‚Äôt worry about taking photos until you get further up in my opinion! We also did the Arashayama bamboo grove which to be honest I felt was a bit underwhelming as it‚Äôs just so full of people.
 
We then did a day trip to Himeji before heading to Hiroshima. I found Himeji a bit of a letdown if I‚Äôm being honest. The outside is far more impressive than the inside. 

Hiroshima itself was a cool place. If you want a nice burger/nice bar, head to The Smith: https://www.instagram.com/the_smith_lab?igsh=YnljYXMxc3Vta2Ni

The Peace Memorial Park was an impressive/sombre place. We spent two days in Miyajima as well. The view at the top of Mount Misen was amazing (if you have your hiking boots) and we also kayaked around the back with the Miyajima Kayak company. Would recommend them! https://miyajima-kayak.jp/en/

We then took a flight to Ishigaki ‚Äì what a beautiful beautiful place. If you can go, I‚Äôd recommend staying at MEGURU - https://meguru-hotel.com. 

It was clean, welcoming and the staff were amazing. It had real wellness-retreat vibes! During our stay in Ishigaki we hired mopeds on one day which was fun and just explored all the different beaches. Also did a day-trip to Taketomi which was a lovely place (and got very sunburnt!).
 
After a week, we flew back to Tokyo where we did the Asakusa area on one day which was cool. If you‚Äôre looking for a capsule hotel recommendation, I couldn‚Äôt recommend these guys more: https://www.booking.com/hotel/jp/resol-poshteldong-jing-qian-cao.en-gb.html 

We then managed to find some good weather to do Mount Fuji ‚Äì hiking up the Subashiri trail and staying the night at the 8th station‚Äôs Tomoekan hut - https://tomoekan.com/plan/english/

Nice place, warm, and good food! We then watched the sunrise the next day at 5am before hiking to the top and then descending.
 
The next day, we were back on the plane home to the UK.
 
Some thoughts -
 
- The only bad meal I had the entire time I was in Japan was (ironically) the most expensive one! It was at Ginza Kojyu, a two Michelin starred restaurant in Tokyo. Actually have no idea how they have these stars as the food was so immemorable and the experience was just a bit bizarre.
- August is a killer weather-wise. It‚Äôs so hot and humid and you were literally sweating five mins after going outside. I couldn‚Äôt change this as that‚Äôs when my partner is able to go away for extended periods due to his job but if you have more flexibility than me, defo go in more manageable conditions!
- I‚Äôd be more flexible with planning the Mount Fuji climb if I were to do it again. Would perhaps have a couple days in mind and see how the weather is looking before travelling to Fujinomiya.
- I‚Äôd take less toiletries. Every hotel we stayed in had toothbrushes, shower gels, pyjamas, creams, razors, etc, so we could have packed lighter.
- A Suica card is essential!
- Tabelog is a great website to see what decent restaurants are in your immediate area.
- Aquarius and Pocari Sweat are godsend drinks on hot, humid days! There is always a vending machine to get one from.
 
Would be more than happy to answer any questions!
 ",https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1nbpdtg/three_weeks_in_japan_overview_and_thoughts/,Just got back from Tokyo yesterday and agree that the weather is hellacious. I‚Äôd been in the summer before but this year seemed to be way worse. Will definitely be skipping the summer in the future,"My only thought was that the Japanese grade harshly. 3 stars is a good thing. I dont know what the fuck 5 stars are but MOST of the good restaurants are 3 stars and when you read what the comments are, its nothing but compliments. In the US, anything below 5 stars is a personal attack on the restaurant.",We did two weeks in Tokyo in 2024 at the same time you did. My son was going to Seikei university and we met him (he speaks fluent Japanese I don‚Äôt speak a word). Hardly a bad meal the whole time. Some more forgetful but nothing outright bad. Unlike my recent trip to Ohio. The weather was miserably hot. It really cut short our days because we were wiped out. We will go back but when it‚Äôs much cooler. We had Suica on our phones. Very easy. The water vending machines were a godsend. We had no problem using credit or debit cards. Although we did carry cash too. We are going back soon,"Different folks, different strokes. I‚Äôm in Japan now and out of the places I‚Äôve stayed the dotinburi area of Osaka was my least favourite. It was just crowded with tourists, shops selling tat and restaurants.Nothing wrong with that but I‚Äôve enjoyed Tokyo, Hiroshima, Nara, Kyoto and now Takayama so much more.",
1mzerzq,"Trip Report: Walking tour of Japan (Hakone, Nakasendo, Kyoto, Kumono Kodo)","After reading this entire subreddit and watching (almost) every Youtube video on Japan walking tours, my wife and I spent an amazing 3 weeks in Japan in May 2025. Stop scrolling and use this itinerary for your own walking tour.

**Shinjuku City, Tokyo**:¬† Beautiful city. Highlights include an early morning walk through Meiji Jingu and Yoyogi Park, in one of the most pedestrian-friendly big cities. However, this trip was focused mostly on nature walks so our stay in Tokyo was short.

**Hakone**:¬† We took the Romance Car from Tokyo to Hakone and spent an amazing two nights at a historic Ryokan. Highlights include the very quiet evenings, Gora Park, the Open Air Museum, and a very early morning walk in Onshi-Hakone Park to view Mt Fuji, before taking the touristy Pirate Ship, and Ropeway (which were fabulous). For being super touristy, this place was gorgeous. We used the gender-separated public onsen, which was amazing.

**Nakasendo Trail**:¬† We spent 4 days walking between post towns Nakasugawa, Magome, Tsumago, Nagiso, Kiso-Fukushima, and Narai. The forest walks and waterfalls were spectacular, but the best views were near the small villages surrounded by rice fields and the beautiful Japanese countryside. Typical morning walks were only 4-5 hours, with slow lunches, and a soak in the onsen after a quiet dinner. We packed very light for this trip and had no trouble with our 12lb day packs. The trails were very quiet, and food and drink options were plentiful with a bit of planning.

**Kanazawa**: One of the prettiest gardens in all of Japan is Kenrokuen and we walked every part of that garden. This was a large city, and so our stay was short.

**Kyoto**: We spent 4 days in Kyoto, and for being a large city it was incredible. A top highlight was a quiet bike ride right along the Kamo River to the botanical garden‚Ä¶, one of our favorite bike rides anywhere, and eating lunch at the very busy Nishiki Market. We walked through a dozen amazing gardens, parks, and shrines, and enjoyed ¬†delicious food at many small restaurants.

**Kumono Kodo**: We spent 5 days on a 75 km pilgrimage walk on a gorgeous forest path, walking between very old moss-covered shrines and quiet mountain streams. Reservations are organized by the Tanabe City Kumono Tourism Bureau, and you must plan many months in advance in order to choose the best locations right near the trail. If you want to be surrounded by some of the best scenery in rural Japan, start planning your trip now. All of the Japanese people (and most of the other visitors) we met along the way were friendly, happy, and kind. We took a few wrong turns, hiked in a downpour, and once had trouble finding an ATM, but enjoyed every minute of it! Thanks Reddit.",https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1mzerzq/trip_report_walking_tour_of_japan_hakone/,"Hiking Nakasendo was my favorite part of my Japan trip. For others reading and looking for more info, we stayed in Nakatsugawa (highly recommend Onn Hotel and Tocaro Burger) and used rail to go to Nagiso and hike down from here to Magome and bus back to Nakatsugawa. This made for an approx 7 mile hike.","Thank you for sharing your experience. I really enjoyed reading your trip report, especially since my dream destination is Japan.","Curious, for Magome, to Tsumago the 4-5 hours, how much time were you in town oppose to on the trail?

I'm doing this section arriving around 10 (starting in Tsumago)  and blocked to 5 before I jump the train to Kyoto. Is that 7 hour block overkill? I am using the luggage transport between the 2 tourist office.

Ideal, I would like to wrap up my walk in 5 hours  so I can get to Kyoto and take advantage of the Sento on my hotels doorstep.

Bear bells. Did you rent, buy one, or use the trail one? Do they sell ""souvenir"" bells in the towns? Do you ever feel you needed a trekking pole?","Hey, thanks for the report!  I'm doing a many of those things on my upcoming trip, especially looking forward to the Kumano Kodo.  Any tips fresh in your mind for that?  (I've also booked through the Kumano Tourism Bureau Site).   Did you walk all the way to Nachi Falls?",Going to hakone in November and finding it hard to find accommodation? Did you like the historic ryokan?
1ndb811,The Beppu hells were amazing except one of them‚Ä¶,"Currently travelling Kyushu and chose Beppu to go to for my 21st birthday. It‚Äôs been amazing so far I absolutely love onsens they completely de-stress me. 

Besides that has anyone else visited the 7 hells of Beppu and thought the crocodile hell was a bit crazy. Like I‚Äôve previously read that Japan is a bit terrible with animal rights and I‚Äôm not usually one to complain but it was absolutely wild. Half of the crocodiles had big open wounds, they were stuffed into tiny, empty cages with a tiny bit of water and no shade. Half of them genuinely looked dead, I thought one of the cages was just a mass grave or something. 

Don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd recommend this spot for tourists maybe just grab the stamp and leave.",https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1ndb811/the_beppu_hells_were_amazing_except_one_of_them/,"Japan has terrible Animal rights.

I've always wanted to go to Beppu and I've never heard of this one. 

I looked up some images and I immediately clocked that there were also.. Alligators? As a native Floridian that's just.. concerning. Alligators and Crocodiles can't really co-exist. The only true place they co-exist is the Florida Everglades. They have plenty of space, perfect temps, and food sources. Japans shitty tiny cages are not that. No wonder why they have open wounds. They probably fight a lot.","Please let me know the name of this one. I am going to Beppu next month and I want to avoid it like the plague. The irony of me working in Ueno Park today and advising against Zoo experience in Japan and now I read this before bed.

1nb352m,11 days in Tokyo - first time - no itinerary,"I don't see a lot of posts calling Tokyo refreshing or relaxing, especially in late August (Aug 27-Sept 6 to be exact).  But for us, that's exactly what it was. 

It was myself (44f), bf (56m), and three boys (18, 20, 21).  We stayed in an apartment in Taito City, equidistant from Akihabara station and Okachimachi station.  It was ideal for us: quiet, no tourists, and easy to get anywhere.  We made heavy use of trains/subways and 15k yen on suica card was just the right amount.

Most of the time, the boys went off on their own for the day while my bf and I did our own thing.  We stayed together only for special trips.  We had no itinerary so each morning we'd look at Google maps, see what was around, and head out.  We did have two must-dos that we do in every country we can and that is to visit IKEA and Costco.  So we went out to Shinmisato on one day and hit both of those.  On Sunday, we all took a steam train to Chichibu and walked around there.  So lovely!!  The temple was amazing, and we had fun walking around so I could find as many Doko Ikubees as I could.  We also took a day trip to Enoshima Island on another day which was wonderful.

A few things:
Yes it was hot and the last day we had heavy rains from the typhoon but it wasn't terrible.  The boys actually went to Disneyland that day despite the rain.  If you've had experience with the southeast US or even Missouri, it'll feel normal.  We currently live in Idaho (I prefer snow and cold) and it seriously wasn't as bad as reddit makes it seem.  We didn't even feel like we needed neck fans or parasols.  

We split up our flight to Tokyo and spent two days in Hawaii beforehand, which resulted in having zero jet lag when we got to Tokyo.  Definitely worth it.

We averaged around 11k steps a day, which is actually what we normally do on a workday at home. That's just the way it worked out for us (not done on purpose) so if you are worried about the redditors saying you have to be ready to do 20+k steps a day, thats them.  You do you.  No special shoes or anything.  We wore our regular vans.

If you have any experience with public transportation like in NYC or Paris (or even LA), Tokyo is just as easy or easier to figure out.  It's bigger, but there are signs everywhere and its just lovely.  We did notice that the ""rule"" about talking on trains was situational - morning commuter subways/trains were totally silent;  mid-afternoon there was usually some talking.  Just be aware of what the locals are doing and always use your library voice.

Some of the main places we ended up going in Tokyo:

Takashita street for one particular store

Tsukiji Hongan-ji Temple and stayed for a ""service""

Tokyo station 

Kappabashi kitchen street which was underwhelming - ended up a few blocks away

Round 1 Ikebukuro

Metropolitan government building

Shinjuku Gyoen

Holy Resurrection Cathedral

mAAch ecute Kanda Manseibashi

Yaesu shopping mall

Lots of book stores and stationary stores


All in all, we loved it so much and it felt so comfortable and homey we are going to make more regular trips and explore more of Japan.
",https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1nb352m/11_days_in_tokyo_first_time_no_itinerary/,"I could be wrong, but I think all of the people here commenting that ""11K steps is \*nothing\*"" and ""You didn't do a lot!"" are missing the point of the OP's post. 

If I understand the post correctly, she's making the point that a lot of the posts in this subreddit are about how Tokyo is hectic and about how it's exhausting to walk 25,000 steps a day and so on - but the OP is pointing out that it's not necessary to do that. She's making the point that it's entirely possible to have a good time in Tokyo, and to see plenty of Tokyo, without speedrunning through multiple districts in one day.","I really like your style of family travel ,going on a trip together, but still having your own time to explore the things you‚Äôre personally interested in.","Nice to see someone not trying to see ""everything"" and rushing all over Tokyo only to have their body give out on them. Having ""no plan"" with a few places in mind is definitely better, especially during the end of August/start of September and everywhere feels like a sauna.","Ya because you didn't have 20 attractions a day and go to places like yoyogi park or takeshita Dori in 40 degrees 99% humidity weather. 

Anywhere can be relaxing if you do it right. I wouldn't mind just staying in a nice hotel, go for a swim and get some spa and facials in Tokyo.",
1msreeg,3-Week Japan Travel Itinerary/Report,"**3-Week Japan Travel Itinerary/Report (May 18 ‚Äì June 6, 2025)**

This May/June, my girlfriend and I traveled through Japan for three weeks together with another couple. I‚Äôd love to share our itinerary and travel experiences with you. It‚Äôs a fairly factual overview, mainly intended to give a general idea of what there is to do and what is feasible in a day. I don‚Äôt review everything in detail, but we honestly enjoyed almost everything‚Äîunless I specifically mention otherwise. Feel free to ask about any specific experiences or practical tips, tho!

* Arrival in Tokyo. Arrival around 2 PM at Narita airport.
* By train and Yamanote line to our apartment in Shinjuku.

**Day 2 (Monday, May 19)**

* Meiji shrine + inner garden
* Yoyogi park (We had planned to go there on Saturday or Sunday, as it‚Äôs said to be very lively on weekends. Due to a problem with our flight, we only arrived in Tokyo on Sunday afternoon, so that didn‚Äôt work out. On Monday the park was very quiet).

* Kappabashi dori
* Ueno park

* Tokyo Skytree. One of the few less enjoyable experiences that generally felt a bit like a tourist trap. The view was quite nice, but we were a bit late so it was already getting dark. Also, it was very crowded and we had to wait a long time to get up and especially to get back down.

**Day 6 (Friday, May 23)**

* Start of a 4-day road trip through the Japanese Alps.
* Arakurayama Sengen Park / Chureito Pagoda. We hoped to see Fuji, but unfortunately it was hidden in the mist so not visible.

* Traditional tea ceremony
* Kenroku-garden
* Kanazawa castle
* Final part of road trip from Kanazawa to Kyoto

**Day 10 (Tuesday, May 27)**

* Nishiki market
* Gion (Sannenzaka, Ninenzaka, Yasaka pagoda, Yasaka shrine).
* Fushimi Inari Taisha. We didn‚Äôt just stay on the main path but also took the ‚Äòhidden trail‚Äô and we loved it. Very beautiful bamboo forest. At the top of Mount Inari a great view over Kyoto by night.

**Day 11 (Tuesday, May 28)**

* Nijo castle
* By Shinkansen from Kyoto to Fukuyama and from there a local train to Onomichi. Great to enjoy an ekiben bought at the train station along the way.

**Day 12 (Wednesday, May 29)**

* Shimanami Kaido! With rented road bikes from Onomichi across islands and bridges through the Seto Inland Sea to Imabari on Shikoku. Very cool for people who enjoy sporty activities like ourselves.

**Day 13 (Thursday, May 30)**

* Trip from Imabari to Hiroshima
* Peace memorial park / Atomic dome / Peace memorial Hall + museum. Impressive..

**Day 14 (Friday, May 31)**

* ROR comedy club.

**Day 20 (Friday, June 6)**

* Traditional Bunraku performance at the National Bunraku theatre.
* Return flight from Osaka back home.

**General experiences/impressions**  
An amazing trip through a beautiful and diverse country with rich culture, history, stunning nature, buzzing modern cities, calm parks, beautiful gardens, friendly people and delicious food. Love the food markets, love the konbinis, LOVE the izakayas.

Our travel pace was high and it was definitely not a ‚Äòrelax vacation‚Äô. But overall it was doable. For fit and active travelers this schedule is feasible, for people who prefer a slower pace it might be (too) intense.

Hopefully this helps you in planning your own trip and feel free to ask me anything you‚Äôd like to know!",https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1msreeg/3week_japan_travel_itineraryreport/,Great review! Would you mind sharing what ryokan you stayed in near Matsumoto?,How was kanazawa in the late afternoon/evening?,We also did the Shimanami Kaido at the end of July.

**IMPORTANT:**¬†The next two days are where we have the most questions and could really use your input! We definitely want to see Mount Fuji, but we know the weather can be unpredictable. To stay flexible, we booked accommodation with a good cancellation policy so we can check the forecast a week before and decide whether to go or not.

That said, we‚Äôre on the fence about renting a car. We‚Äôre fairly experienced drivers (we drive almost every day), but we‚Äôve never driven on the left side of the road. Plus, Toyota Rent-a-Car requires cancellations 7 days in advance, which doesn‚Äôt give us much flexibility.

How realistic is it to rent a car closer to the date instead? And if we don‚Äôt rent one, would it still be enjoyable to explore the area by bicycle?

That‚Äôs our rough itinerary for now, and I‚Äôd really appreciate any advice, suggestions, or adjustments you think could make it better.

If you‚Äôve made it this far, thank you so much for taking the time to read through everything! It means a lot!

I‚Äôm really looking forward to hearing your thoughts. Wishing you all a great day!",https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1mtrb7u/dream_trip_itinerary_22_full_days_in_japan_2025/,"Hello. I am a resident of Osaka.

So you will want to print out your Icoca train cards at the airport train station from the machine, and you can add money to those with cash at those same machines and those you can use almost everywhere. JR passes are only with JR railways or buses afterall.

When you visit Namba, you can walk between nippombashi, shinsaibashi easily don't bother with metro for those short areas.

It seems you are interested in Shrines and temples. I love visiting them too. If you are interested in visiting many and having something to remember them by, then you need to get a Goshuin book. You can get a Goshuin book from a larger shrine which will sell their own. In the Goshuin book the monk or Miko will write the stamp of the shrine recognizing that you visited there on that day. Many shrines close their services after 4 or 5 so just know that and in general Most japanese people don't like to visit shrines at night since that is when the spirits come out. Most shrines of note will have this and it really is cool in my opinion. It is best practice to have two books, one for Shinto shrines and one for Buddhist temples but that isnt a strict rule. I have heard shrines refuse to write in a mixed book though. It's usually not so expensive but you need to carry coins which is something that is necessary in general in Japan.

In Osaka I would recommend actually going to Sumiyoshi Taisha for a shrine trip as it is the most famous shrine in Osaka and is fairly close to Tenouji.

There is also Tenma which has the longest arcade street in Japan. In general the best food is often hidden, and a bit difficult for tourists to go to since they don't cater directly to English. All I can say is push yourself a little to go to places that might seem local. At least try not to end up going to macdonalds simply because you are unfamiliar or uncomfortable with actual restaurants, this is something I see alot of tourist struggle with.

Minoh has a famous onsen hotel right next to the hiking road to the waterfall, so you can visit that I think just for a dip into the onsen. 

Kyoto has so much going on that it is crazy. I have been countless times and I have yet to see even 1/4 of what it has going for it. It is also incredibly busy in the more famous areas like Fushimi inari or kiyomizu or kinkakuji. I would recommend walking most of it and don't rely on the buses unless you want to cross the city. You can also rent out e bikes if you want to get to see even more places.

That is enough advice but I'll end it by saying the food you should try.

In Osaka - Okonomiyaki, takoyaki
Hiroshima - Hiroshimayaki, 
Shizuoka - Unagi
Tokyo - Sushi
Kyoto - Obanzai","I would strongly recommend looking at things on a map and staying on one side of town rather than using buses to criss cross  Kyoto. Kinkaku-Ji and ginkaku-ji on the same day is a recipe for frustration. 

Late October is, in my experience, too early for spectacular foliage in Kyoto  and tonyo has comparatively fewer trees. (Yes there are parks, it is not the same). Hakone maybe but the one time I was there in oct/nov it was still mostly green. We did get a beautiful clear day for Fuji though

My over arching thought- you are trying to cram too much in. Build in some days with few activities and cut back on some things. For example Himeji castle - that was at least half a day by itself every time I have been. It‚Äôs a good 20 minute walk from the station (with shops to distract) and the grounds are large ( plus garden next door). Trying to cram Okayama and himeji into the same day will mean you miss something. 

I get trying to fit everything in when it is a dream trip, but you assuming very short transition times and time spent at places as short. 
The. Memories often come from the random places you find. Stepson remembers the (IMO very average) ramen place we went to on the day we went to kitchen town. Sister remembers the tempura place in Kyoto we stumbled on.","If you can change your schedule, going straight to Kyoto from the airport and staying there for 8-9 days might be better. You could then ""commute"" to Osaka and Nara for sightseeing. This would reduce the amount of times you need to move your luggage. From Hiroshima, you can take a side trip to Matsuyama by ferry and spending a night. From either Matsuyama or Hiroshima, you can fly to Haneda airport. From Haneda, a direct bus to Hakone leaves around 15:30. This minimizes the hustle of securing a luggage space on Shinkansen (you have to do it twice since Nozomi train doesn‚Äôt stop at Odawara).","You don't really need to reserve the train to go to Kawaguchiko: regular trains go out there...regularly. They don't take all that much longer than reserved-seating trains and (in my likely idiosyncratic opinion) are more comfortable than and give better view than reserved-seating trains.

Though I have a Japanese driving license and all the driving I have done in the past maybe 20(?) years has been in Japan, I would hesitate to drive to Kawaguchiko simply because the last time our child went out there (on a bus), the return was pushed back by 3 hours because there had been an accident in one of the tunnels leading to Tokyo that backed up traffic.",

What is this itinerary missing in your opinion? Is there anything not worth doing? My partner is also pregnant or we‚Äôd probably have a more intensive itinerary to cover a lot more 

Thank you in advance for any suggestions or opinions 
",https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1myrs6a/14_day_tokyokyotoosaka_itinerary_anything_key/,"I always suggest doing your shopping LAST, just so you don't blow your budget before doing all you want to do, and less worry of luggage logistics. And honestly, you can find almost everything you want in Osaka rather than Tokio, so that's one advice.  

* Day 1: no comments.  
* Day 2: If you're doing Shibuya + Kaminarimon (Senso-ji), you might as well move SkyTree to this day; you're already going to Asakusa for Senso-ji, take advantage of that. Id' throw in Yoyogi Park/Meiji Shrine, do a full circle around Tokio on the Yamanote Line, or you'll just waste a lot of time going to opposite ends of Tokio.  
* Day 3: No comments.  
* Day 4: You could add the Unicorn Gundam in the Tokyo bay and Zojo-ji and Tokio Tower, you're already on the area and have time.  
* Day 5: What are you exactly planning? Hiking? I hope not, at least not with a pregnant woman. Also, the hiking season is only on summer, and you'll need to rent a car. I suggest you reconsider and change it for a day trip to Kawaguchi Lake, where you can see mount Fuji (It's one of the Fuji 5 Lakes).  
* Day 6: The imperial palace is skippable, tbh, and I see little benefit on the hop-on bus, It'll basically take you where you've already been to. I'd suggest dedicate this day to only shopping.  
* Day 7: The bullet train to Kyoto is less than 4h, you have half a day to still add stuff.  
* Day 8: Reconsider. Fushimi Inari with a pregnant woman is more than too much, unless you are just gonna go to the main entrance and not go up. If that's your plan, then better skip it alltogether. Also, Arashiyama, Fushimi Inari and Kiyomizu are on extreme opposites of the city, you'll waste at least 1h moving to each one, and given that shrines and temples close at 5pm, it's a waste of your morning. Take your Day 13 free day and add another one to Kyoto. If you don't, then skip arashiyama and fushimi inari, and just focus on the Higashiyama side of Kioto (Kiyomizudera, Kennin-ji, Sanjusangendo, Kodai-ji, Ryozen Kannon). Less extenuating, more to see.  
* Day 9: No comments.  
* Day 10: Too little in Osaka. Add the Osaka Castle, and Namba/Shinsekai for the evening, at the very least. Abeno Harukas has a free observatory that I'd suggest over Umeda Sky.  
* Day 11: No comments except the suggestion that you move the shopping to Day 13.  
* Day 12: No comments.  
* Day 13: I'd suggest using this free day and putting as a buffer between day 11 and 12, give yourselves a rest. Go to an onsen. Specially with a pregnant woman. This schedule is already packed as is for a person in good physical condition.  

As a whole, I'd shave off activities where possible, adding more break days or at least only morning activities and evening breaks. Depending how advanced the pregnancy, she'll be able to do at most half of this, because it's TOO MUCH WALKING.",There are better things to do than devote a whole day to both Teamlabs IMHo!,"If you like ""old"" Japan (temples, shrines, castles, palaces, gardens, performing arts, maiko-san, etc.), spend as much time in Kyoto as possible. You could spend weeks sightseeing in Kyoto without getting bored. You can cut out other plans to make more time for Kyoto. If you ask me, I'll give you a list of must-see sights in Kyoto.

Tokyo Disneyland is almost the same as Disneyland in Anaheim, so it seems like a waste of time to me. The lines can be long, and miserable in summer heat. Asakusa Shrine and Senso-ji Temple is a fun area with souvenir stands and restaurants. The other commenter is right that the Imperial Palace in Tokyo isn't much to see.

Kamakura near Tokyo is also interesting for ""old"" Japan, but it might be redundant with Kyoto and Nara.

I thought Osaka Castle was disappointing--Himeji Castle is much better.","Some thoughts:

**Tokyo**: You'll want to group these a little better geographically. Shibuya and Asakusa (Senso-ji) are on opposite sides of Tokyo and same with Sky Tree and the two TeamLabs. Not to mention Asakusa and Tokyo Sky Tree are very close. Although to be honest I would probably split the TeamLabs to two different days to have more time to appreciate them individually, but to each their own. 

As far as what you're missing in Tokyo - there's a lot that you're missing but I understand that you scaled it back on purpose for your partner. I would consider Shibuya Sky and Tokyo Tower as options that are already within walking distance of places you're already going to. Other places that are a short train ride away from the places you already have scheduled include Harajuku, Ginza, Ueno, Shinjuku, and Odaiba. 

Also, what month are you planning on visiting? I am someone who absolutely loves nature but if you aren't going during the fall foliage season I would *consider* skipping the imperial palace garden and going to one of the areas I mentioned above that you're missing. 

**Day Trip to Mount Fuji**: Not sure if you're saying you want to actually go to Mt Fuji or if you mean one of the surrounding areas known for viewing Mt Fuji from afar. Personally it's not my style of day trip, it's one of the longer day trips from Tokyo and if you do it as a day trip (as opposed to an overnight stay) you increase the risk of going on a cloudy day and being disappointed. It's fine if that's what you want, but some other day trips I would consider include Yokohama, Kamakura & Enoshima Island, and Kawagoe.

**Kyoto**: Again, geography. Put some pins on Google maps, those locations are not close at all and Kyoto's public transit system is not as robust as Tokyo's or Osaka's. Either find an extra day in Kyoto or just pick one area. My choice would be Kiyomizu-dera if I had to pick one, although be warned that it's a decently lengthy walk from the Gojozaka bus stop that's entirely uphill. Not sure if that'll be too rough on your partner.

**Nara**: Nara looks good, just keep in mind (again for your partner) that Nara is a lot of walking. Relatively flat terrain but just thought I'd mention it.

**Osaka**: You're barely scratching the surface of Osaka but it'll be up to you to balance this with any other changes you make to previous days. I wouldn't say skip the world expo since it's a one-time thing but I would think about if you need to do both Disneyland and Universal. Just my personal preference but I wouldn't want to pass on some of the more unique Japan experiences to go to two theme parks. That being said I know some people love them. Maybe come back years from now when that kid of yours is older lol. Definitely don't miss out on seeing Dotonbori at least once and consider replacing Umeda Sky with Abeno Harukas (unless you're really into architecture since the Umeda Sky building is super cool) as it's more centrally located to Namba and Shinsekai.

Last thoughts: Don't underestimate the amount of walking this will be. Even if you group things geographically, everything in Japan is walking-heavy. Going through train stations, walking through castles/temples, shopping, theme parks, World Expo, etc., it all rapidly adds up to thousands and thousands of steps per day. Either start walking now to prepare or create a backup itinerary in case you realize two days in that it's gonna be too intensive.",
1mp4zw4,"Trip Report: 12 Days in Japan, Solo Alcoholic‚Äôs Sakura Pilgrimage","With money from my summer internship flooding in, I decided well in advance to see the sakura in April for peak Japan. A full budget breakdown will be at the end including a link to the Spreadsheet I used to track my expenses. This was a solo trip I began planning for 8 months. I tend to overplan before cutting stuff out in the moment. This is going to be very in depth, so strap in and grab some popcorn if you want to tuck in!

Day -1: Flying nonstop MSP to HND was ~$1500 for regular Economy. I have my classic drink order: Woodford Reserve whiskey to sleep lol

**Day 0: High Table**: Landing in Haneda (HND), it took just 30 minutes from getting off the plane to leaving customs with my backpack and checked luggage. I reserved a 3GB Pocket WiFi from NinjaWiFi like always, which was plenty for solo travelling and using Google Maps every other moment. I used Timeshifter to help minimize my jet lag, which did help!! I also had melatonin with me as well to ensure my best chances of being jet lagged for not that long. I reserved a Gran Class ticket (to be used later) with my JR Rail Pass at the JR East Travel Center, and got some free chopsticks, neat! I wandered around Haneda Airport Garden but wasn‚Äôt too impressed.

LODGING, which I booked for my whole March 31 - April 12 stay: Pegasus Hostel. 200 USD total via AirBnB.

While the hostel was a little cramped, and you have to carry luggage up stairs, the in unit (I forgot if it was coin operated) laundry and free WiFi is nice to have, and I was more than happy given how cheap the accommodation was. The receptionist mainly speaks Mandarin, so my Cantonese did not really work, and we made do with English and Google Translate which had no issues. Let me tell ya, this hostel is a sleeper pick location-wise!! You are <5 min away walking from Asakusabashi Station, ONE stop away from Akihabara, ONE train ride to-from HND if you take Keisei thru line to the Asakusa Line, and a more involved walk to Bakuroch≈ç Station. There is a FamilyMart and 7-Eleven within a 2 minute walk, along with Naruto Taiyaki Honpo Asakusabashi shop for a nice evening Taiyaki. There is a caveat though, taking the Chuo Line from here is almost always super busy, and the station‚Äôs east exit is a little cramped, so I would not recommend it as much if you have more than 1 rolling luggage.

I ate supper over in Akihabara at Wako Tonkatsu Akiba 8th Floor, as PremierTwo recommended it, quite nice and super filling! I would need this to prepare my liver for‚Ä¶

HIGHLIGHT: Bar BenFiddich. I had to reserve this in advance, and I felt ultra intimidated being in such a curated and intimate space. I felt small in my expansive seat, as I was seated right in front of Hiroyasu Kayama himself! I got to see him make most of the drinks ordered in that 2 hour slot, and it was magical. I had to wrack my imagination for drink orders since this place has no menu. He put me at ease, and made 3 cocktails that I will never forget.

*Scotch? + Passion fruit w/ Muscat Liquor, chocolate?, and fennel sprinkles*

My request: something using the muscat grape. He blowtorched the top?! WHAT. But it was a brilliant gradient of flavor.

*Japanese Gin w/ Lavender Distilled Water*

My request: something floral. It‚Äôs perfectly fragrant, topped with a sprig of lavender. It‚Äôs wavy in the sense of winds going over a lavender field.

*Chery Brandy + Drouet Cognac VS Grande Champagne*

My request: ‚Äúa warm hug on a cold snowing day.‚Äù He then makes this HOT tiny dainty signature cocktail, which was literally on fire at some point. WHAT. It was right on point with my abstract request, and my only regret was that I could not finish it‚Ä¶ because 3 drinks would put me to sleep. I am a lightweight, 6‚Äô 2‚Äù, 160 lbs, half white (Germany + Wales), half Chinese, and 2 drinks is enough to make me drunk. I needed to make sure I could take the train back to my hostel lmaooo

Step Count: roughly 9k steps

**Day 1: Eye‚Äôs Up**: It‚Äôs April Fool‚Äôs Day, so I did not sleep great, only sleeping 11-3-5-6? The rain in the morning was not welcome. Maybe it being April Fool‚Äôs was unrelated. I ate breakfast at Kameido Gusto (decent, but would‚Äôve preferred a konbini) before buying a shirt from Work Land. I got new glasses at Jins (Akihabara Yodobashi Camera), but it took 2 days of having a mental breakdown before I started liking the glasses lmaoooo. 

Lunch was at Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building‚Äôs Cafeteria bc I make it a consistent staple to eat there once per Japan trip. The curry was good, but the cafe pastry left much to be desired.

I bought souvenirs at Shinjuku Marui Annex before walking to Shinjuku Gyoen National Garden which was not that busy due to the light rain throughout the whole day. I sauntered into Omotesando but did not buy anything there. I took the train back, and it stopped for several minutes, an odd occurrence‚Ä¶ My night ends with a mashup supper of a 7-Eleven onigiri, a FamilyMart fried chicken, and some dried persimmons before going to SAKE street nearby for a flight of sweet sake.

**Day 2: PremierMe**: After a crisp 9 hours of sleep, I‚Äôm up for breakfast at Ootoya. HIGHLY RECOMMEND! For only 600 JPY, I got red rice, miso soup, chicken, and unlimited drinks. A killer breakfast set for basically $4 USD. Once again, my train stops in the middle of the line‚Ä¶ huh. 

I spend a fair amount of time taking Shinkansen pictures from the Nippori Station‚Äôs North Bridge before trying to find cats at Yanaka Ginza. The rain eventually stops, but not before I get some gelato and a latte from Guru Guru. The Yanaka Cemetery is a great place to visit. A stroll around leads to some peaceful adages, loads of sakura, and the rare stray cat. Another train down to Ueno leads to plenty of souvenirs, shaved ice, and lunch at Uo Tsuka: full of oysters, ikura-don, and a sweet sake to pair with the seafood. I eventually end up at Ishibashiinari Shrine where I adjust my itinerary until loud bells begin ringing. It‚Äôs 3PM, and a ceremony of sorts seems to be happening. I bask in the loud noises, before I drop off my purchases at my hostel.

Following a few of the steps that PermierTwo took in his 2024 Meguro walk and talk, I witness the sakura festival at Naka-Meguro! Stopping at Kura Sushi for supper, I go to the raised crossing that is the inspiration for the location where Akane Kurokawa is saved by Aqua Hoshino in Oshi no Ko Season 1. A bit of a trek from the station, but nothing unusual. I stop at Traveler‚Äôs Factory, a haven for stationary lovers, although I only buy a small notebook refill there. Next is SLOWJAM GARAGE for a sakura highball, where somehow I feel a brief and fleeting sense of community. I get a bit more food, some gyoza at Ohka the Bestdays.

Last stop of the day was Bar Panorma Ginza, which fun fact: is not located in Ginza. A pain to find, but once you enter you are in a textbook otaku paradise. No no, not for anime. Trains! The bulk of the floorplan is taken up by the lovely trainset! A shinkansen zips around. A local train whirs past, and there are more model trains on the walls! All of the drinks are train line themed, you HAVE to order the Yamanote Line drink if you like sweet and/or melon.

To unwind, I went to Akihabara because I found a Taiko machine cheaper than all the others‚Ä¶ how? I got 3 songs per play instead of 2‚Ä¶ ohohoho it is #MusicMaxxing time! I would do this most nights‚Ä¶ I like combining violence (hitting a drum) with music (anime openings).

20.3k steps

**Day 3: A Simple Meal**: I didn't sleep that long, which was okay because I spent 6 hours in Akihabara! I got Pork Belly Curry for lunch at Hinoya Curry before spending 2x retail price on a countryside Miku figurine at a crane game, oof. I popped into Yusha Kobo which is a super cool physical keyboard shop. Yeah, you‚Äôre better off buying it all online, but it‚Äôs nice to see and test the keyboards and switches yourself!~ 

I waltz on over to Shibuya, and I immediately get lost. Not in the station, but in the basement department store of Shibuya Mark City. I swear, every department store could use better wayfinding, but I‚Äôll live. I eventually found Kageyamarou to have some soba for supper! A perfect fuel for the drinks I am about to indulge in, I get out on the streets, and what‚Äôs that? PLAYERS by YOASOBI is playing! I am so elated, I saunter, skip, and dance my way down the street to LOST Bar. I enjoy the April Cocktail: License to Chill, Like a Magic Mule, and the cracker-cheese plate! I push myself to eat it all, even if I accidentally stalled my appetite‚Ä¶ oops lol my greed tends to get the best of me >~>

**Day 4: A-S-O So Much Volcano**: It is time to be ambitious! I take a 7AM flight down to Kumamoto, with a rental car in wait, ready to drive towards Aso. No, there were no Pikachu plushies in the vending machines, very sad. I was amazed security took only 1 minute AND I could bring water through security??? America could never. I miss spotting Mt Fuji from the plane which is very sad, but I was about to see more mountains!

The rental kei car was awesome! Getting >50 mpg, taking only <10 seconds on ignition for it to recognize and automatically play music from my iPad, and the snazzy gps. Oooo, now this is a nice upgrade from my Chevy Spark. While it was only 57F outside, it was warm coming from Minnesota~. Ozu Roadside Station was filled with samples aplenty, so ofc I had to buy some Ube Cheesecake, which was the tastiest thing I sampled there. I try horse meat in a bun at Michi no Eki Aso, and I even get to glimpse the Seven Stars of Kyushu train there! 

Next up is Milk Factory for some cheese on soft serve, before winding up to Daikambo Lookout Point. Something worth mentioning is that even on these mountainy roads, everyone is going 10-20 kmph over the speed limit. A brief visit to Meoto Falls, preps me for the quaint town of Kurokawa Onsen. Did I go there because it shared a last name with my favorite anime character in *Oshi no Ko*? Yes. Did I also go there because of the nice onsens? Yes. 

LODGING: Yamamizuki. I splurged 40480 JPY for a night here with their seasonal kaiseki meals. There is so much info, so I am shaking with worry, but this time I do not get an anxiety attack trying to put on my yukata! I take a quick bath before I see my FIVE COURSE KAISEKI and another portion laid out in front of me. Because the room was for 2, there were 2 portions (next breakfast would only have 1 though), so I got extras of the real good stuff~! There was so much food, all so good, this was well worth the steep cost! I go back into the onsen before I fall asleep to the river noises beyond my window.

7.2k steps

**Day 5: POP IN 2**: Waking up at 5AM means that I get to take an early bath! There were two tourists speaking Cantonese in the bath so I *had to* reply back in Cantonese (bc my mother is from Guangzhou). The two men were stunned, and I will forever grin at their shocked expressions. Breakfast was plentiful, and I finished the last bit of sake before I *pop in 2* the tourist center in town to buy a couple towels and a pouch to carry them in. Driving down to Takachiho, I park at the Eki store after checking that parking by the gorge is all full. It‚Äôs ‚Ä¶ just about walkable (downhill is okay, it‚Äôs uphill that‚Äôs rough) over to my reservation for‚Ä¶

HIGHLIGHT: Rowboat in Takachiho Gorge! It‚Äôs genuinely quite beautiful, you get to be tens of feet deep as you maneuver yourself along the black rock and falling water.

I spy a local shop on my way walking up, where I got some dango with walnut sauce and an orange-mango swirl soft serve! What‚Äôs up with soft serve? I guess America is also a fan of soft serve in fast food and such, but is there any reason why Japan likes soft serve too? Let me know! Next is the freshwater aquarium, a nice quaint place with a sturgeon, an axolotl, and more! I chose this area because it‚Äôs where *Oshi no Ko* begins! I **just missed** the Oshi no Ko Season 2 x Takachiho collab event, but thankfully a couple places still had merch left! 

Around this time, I have a mental breakdown because I bought the Onsen Pass at Kurokawa Onsen and have yet to use it, so I hastily drive back to Kurokawa to use ‚Öî of the pass at Sanga Ryokan for the baths and a fruit drink. It starts raining on my parade back to Kumamoto, and then I make a minor mistake at KMJ. I accidentally bought frozen basashi instead of fresh, and I threw it out because I did not have facilities at my hostel to work with it. Curse me being rushed and not wanting to say no to the shopkeep. I still slept an hour on the flight though! 

8.5k steps

**Day 6: TOP LINE, TOP CLASS**: I lost that Gran Class ticket I booked ;-; so I had to buy a new one‚Ä¶ At least Gran Class is SUPER CUSHY. Free slippers, water, Katsuyama Ken Sake, a small meal? It was so nice, I even did some homework on the train to Morioka. But the train of bad news does not stop only there. Turns out I LEFT my Apple Pencil on the train. After anxiously waiting with the staff, I was told to check back with the Sendai staff (as I‚Äôd be there in 2 hours). At least Morioka Station had heat lamps, that was nice. Plus I had a cheap and swift lunch at Soba no Hana. 

As per the staff in Sendai, it turns out my Apple Pencil went all the way to Hakodate. That‚Äôs not good. Because I booked a hostel, the receptionist wanted me to be there on arrival to pay for the delivery, and I could not make that happen with what I had reserved‚Ä¶ but wait! I will be in Kusatsu Onsen for a night, I can have them deliver it there! We communicated, and in a few days I will have my Apple Pencil again; the cornerstone to a third of all of the college notes I‚Äôve written (bc paper notes take up physical space). Sadly, this meant I could not do anything in Sendai EXCEPT for a load of food stalls in the station plaza?! I gaze around before it settles on a booth with alcohol. I sample some local sake and wine? You heard that right, grape wine! This was a welcome surprise because I just started getting into wine this year. Now onto‚Ä¶

Utsunomiya! I‚Äôm here thanks to Jake Valiane's video on the city citing its notably hospitable bartenders. I peeped a shinkansen barrel through the station, before I spotted a lil light rail, just like home (minus the bullet train). Supper was decided to be a local specialty: gyoza! Coined in by the dog encased in one inside Utsunomiya Station, I head to 365 Gyoza Bar for some delectable gyoza. I have to admit, I am pretty ambivalent to dumpling-like things of [thing] encased in [carb casing], but those were nice!

LODGING: Utsunomiya Tobu Hotel Grande. A really cheap hotel accessible by bus from the train station, I had a whole room with nice amenities. There was also a newspaper vending machine? I suppose people still read those. I used to once when I worked at a gas station in All-There-Is-Is-Corn, Minnesota. 

As someone who can only have 2 standard drinks maximum to not be sedated like someone shot by a tranquilizer, I had to choose my bar time carefully. Do I go to one bar having 2 drinks or two bars having 1 drink? I chose the one bar strat. In Bar Juice, we have a lovely bartender! He can speak good English, and we talked about our lives before a couple came in. This was a Sunday night, so the four of us shot the shit as I indulged in a seasonal strawberry cocktail and a matcha cocktail so me and the couple ordered the same two cocktails! This was perfect, not at all pretentious, and I would genuinely go here every night if I lived in the same city. The price was decent, the table charge snack plentiful, and I got a branded small set of matches to take home!

16k steps.

**Day 7: Sake Country**: Turns out I keep yapping so I will try to summarize‚Ä¶ oops. It‚Äôs a huge reach of the day, taking the shinkansen from Utsunomiya to Gala Yuzawa to Niigata to Tokyo in one day! Gala Yuzawa is relevant so I can see snow, go into a small onsen, enjoy the footbath by Yuzawa Station, get complimented on my Japanese, and enjoy the sake vending machines inside the station!

Niigata is obvious: Sake. I toured Imayotsukasa Sake Brewery and chatted with someone travelling from Finland! We enjoy the Niigata Station sake vending machines together before we go our own ways.

Tokyo is back but so is Shinjuku?! HUUUUUH? That‚Äôs right, I got a 2nd reservation for Bar BenFiddich at 11PM. Drink 1 is something herbal: Wrymwood Gimlet. Drink 2 features Japanese ingredients: Smooth Matcha Old Fashioned. That cocktail was genuinely perfect, a touch of walnut liquor and coconut water making is extremely easy to drink. I would actually drink one every night if I could. Since me and a couple nearby were chatty, I got to try a Fernet and Bar BenFiddich‚Äôs Absinthe. I absolutely will return again.

Lodging: Shinjuku Nikka. Here for something super cheap, a walkable distance, and easily accessed when the trains have stopped running.

14.6k steps.

**Day 8: Wine Country**: By this point, I have successfully paid off the 7 Day Japan Rail Pass! You know what that means? Time to take a convenient Limited Express to the local Chuo Line to Katsunumabudokyo Station. A lovely trip, passing by the maglev shinkansen test track, we arrive at loads of vineyards and sakura! Super scenic!! This is a guaranteed HIGHLIGHT with how pretty the station looks in April. I spend time in Budou no Oka‚Äôs wine cave to indulge and sample on locally made wine~ 

I head on back and rest in my bed before eating mackerel ramen at Seafudou. Mmm, fish. I walk to Jimbocho to buy some doujins for me and a friend, walk to Ochanomizu for the train photospot, and walk next door to Akihabara. I spend more time playing Taiko no Tatsujin, and I drink a Sapporo before I sleep.

13.7k steps.

**Day 9: Warm Sulfur Town**: I meet up with a friend and her mom at Ueno so we can take the JR Kusatsu Limited Express train + bus up to Kusatsu Onsen!

By this point, I have not only paid off the Rail Pass, but the Green Car version. That‚Äôs right, I bought the Green Car version of the 7 Day Japan Rail Pass. I wanted to ensure I got guaranteed seats since I noticed that some trains were completely full when I went to Japan the month prior with my parents.

LODGING: Kusatsu Onsen Eiyada! I have dinner there before I walk around town with my friend, going into baths along the way. I sleep to some Japanese TV.

9.5k steps.

**Day 10: Cheesy Nightlife**: I see my friend off as she flies back this afternoon, and think over my plans as I go into the 4 increasingly hot baths in Otaki no Yu. I buy some grape juice and camembert from Karuizawa before taking the shinkansen to Omiya for the Railroad Museum! There was so much to see, and even more I could buy from the gift shop. A MUST VISIT if you are into trains even a little bit. Omiya Station also had something going on, so I sampled a couple sweet sake before making a snap choice to‚Ä¶

Return to Utsunomiya! Bar Juice was so good, I had to go again to give the bartender a bar of dark chocolate from Trader Joe‚Äôs I had brought with me on the trip. I also visit Bar Yamanoi (the one operated by the son, not the father bc there‚Äôs two) to try the Ryokubi! I love yuzu and muscat, what can I say? The shinkansen takes me back~

17k steps.

**Day 11: 25 Cour**: I skip breakfast as I wander around Tokyo Station for one key reason: 25 Course Omakase at Manten Sushi Nihonbashi for lunch. I just barely survived, but hot damn was everything really good! One minor gripe was that they did not tell you how much drinks cost and I found out when the bill arrived :p 

Around this point, I ran out of money in my bank account so I was rationing what little cash and IC card money I had. No, I did not buy the $200 four liter sized mango, but I really wanted to though‚Ä¶ I pop into Shibuya 109 for an Oshi no Ko pop up store before heading down to Enoshima Treasure Cafe for a Miss Kobayashi‚Äôs Dragon Maid collab cafe! With that being my #2 fav anime of all time, I had to go for the goodies. I went back up to Asakusabashi but not after trying to 100% Fatal on Normal Mode in Taiko.

12.2k steps

**Day 12: Prince of Speed**: I furiously pack and keep my luggage waiting in the hostel before heading to Ikebukuro. Why there?? A Dungeon Meshi collab cafe of course. Somehow, I got a $400 refund from my university. Not sure HOW, but better late than never? I play Taiko one last time in Akihabara before I take my one train from Asakusabashi to HND Terminal 3. 

I unfortunately fell into the trap of making my checked bag too heavy, so I had to move 1 kg into my backpack. It almost always happens to my mom, and I thought it would never happen to me. Ah, well. Thanks to Face Express, instead of lining up in the long 100+ person line, I got to line up behind only about 20 instead, thanks Japan! I use the last of my cash and coins on 7-Eleven and vending machine stuff to have food on the flight all the way back to the Land of 1000 Lakes. I will return again next year!

1n4vqxs,Trip Report: 4 Days in Nagasaki,"Just discovered this sub and decided to do a report on a short trip I took to Nagasaki last week. Going into it, I was mainly interested in Nagasaki for its history, from its founding as a Christian city by the Jesuits to its status as the primary gateway between the world and a closed-off Japan during the Edo period.

That part was great as expected, but what I didn't expect was how gorgeous the city and nearby countryside were. The city is surrounded by mountains covered in lush green forests, which as a Tokyo resident was kind of mind-blowing.

Kyushu has seen record flooding this year, and I think there was literally a typhoon passing by Kagoshima during my flight there, but miraculously we had beautiful (but very hot and humid) weather everywhere we went.

I stayed at [Hotel H2 Nagasaki](https://maps.app.goo.gl/rshAX1b6nESmQpD56), which was perfectly fine but nothing special. Breakfast definitely not worth it. Good location close to Hamamachi and Chinatown, where all the restaurants are.

Day 1 (Atomic Bomb Stuff)

* Arrived at Nagasaki Airport in the morning (on an Exeggutor themed plane!) and took the \~40 min bus to Nagasaki Station. Fare is 1200 yen and IC cards (Suica, etc.) are accepted.
* Friend arrived on a later flight, so while waiting I visited the [Twenty-Six Martyrs Museum and Monument](https://maps.app.goo.gl/qHpar4unwxBrGBEP8), built to commemorate a 1597 public execution of Christians by Hideyoshi. The museum is small with informative exhibits on the history of the incident and the Portuguese/Spanish mission in Japan more broadly. There was lots in English and other languages as I believe the site has been officially recognized by the Catholic Church (Popes Francis and John Paul II visited).
* Met up with friend at her hotel and ate lunch at nearby [Edo Bishi](https://maps.app.goo.gl/remYbHFz35m7XzmV8). Very homey place for Nagasaki Chinese food. We were literally served by two elementary school children who must have been on summer break. The signature dish of Nagasaki is champon, which is just a bunch of vegetables and seafood thrown on top of noodle soup, supposedly invented by a Chinese chef who wanted to provide poor Chinese students studying in Japan with something cheap and nutritious. I opted for its soupless variant (instead smothered in goopy sauce), called *sara udon* (literally ""noodles on a plate""; it's not actually udon noodles), which was delicious.
* Took the cute tram to the [Atomic Bomb Museum](https://maps.app.goo.gl/bNQzhsS5ynprbD468). There aren't really any words to describe the experience or why you should go. If you're in Nagasaki for the first time, just go. It was smaller than I was expecting, took about 2 hours. After you're done it's a short stroll up to the [Peace Park](https://maps.app.goo.gl/azLEYbxjEVd2ftjBA), where there's a memorial at the hypocenter with remnants of the original Urakami Cathedral, and further along the famous statue of the man pointing up with one hand to warn of the dangers of the bomb and sideways with the other to signify peace.
* Walked a bit to the rebuilt [Urakami Cathedral](https://maps.app.goo.gl/FGNXseb6JZLDoTC7A). Not much to see, but you can peek inside for free. On display is a haunting bust of the Virgin Mary that was exposed to the bomb. It looked so symbolic that at first I thought it was an art piece.
* Bought some locally grown grapes at [Iwanaga Fruits](https://maps.app.goo.gl/znwZAfGQ9hr3NJaF9) just across the street before hopping on a bus to [Sanno Shrine](https://maps.app.goo.gl/4t9RJnxdFGxaw4ci7) (you get off at Sakamotomachi), where there is a famous torii gate standing on one leg after the other half was blown away by the blast, as well as two camphor trees which appeared totally dead after exposure to the bomb only to grow again into the giants they are today. The beautiful song [Kusunoki ](https://youtu.be/vuxCfIijgIc)by Masaharu Fukuyama (super celebrity born in Nagasaki) is about these two trees and was featured at this year's remembrance ceremony.
* Back to the city center for dinner at [El Dorado Mexican Restaurant & Bar](https://maps.app.goo.gl/S1NbezkxnPoH6q179) (lol). It was very good but obviously most tourists aren't going to come to Japan and eat Mexican food. I live in Tokyo, where it's relatively hard to find, so that's why I wanted to go.

Day 2 (Shimabara)

* Rented a car with [Toyota ](https://maps.app.goo.gl/rhygf8HJyp29agLs7)and drove out to the Shimabara Peninsula, stopping at a small bakery [Patisserie Boulangerie Pack](https://maps.app.goo.gl/9b6RwH9weeU2CZLz7) along the way in Obama (!). Picked up a red-bean bun, nothing special but the grandma was nice. The whole drive was scenic. Stopped to get out at this [viewing point](https://maps.app.goo.gl/6LRaLjqcNqCLa7L79) overlooking terraced potato fields.
* Arrived at Kuchinotsu for dolphin watching with [Minamishimabara Dolphin Watching](https://maps.app.goo.gl/FAVUWbobFx8HafuK8), booked online about a week prior. You have to check in at reception 20 minutes before departure. The group was fairly large so we split into two boats. Besides us and a group of Chinese tourists, it seemed like mostly local families with kids. Most of the \~80 minutes was spent going farther out into the sea and then back again, but we were lucky enough to see a large pod of dolphins. There must have been at least 20 all swimming together very close to the boat. Unfortunately we didn't get to spend much time with them as we had to get back to port, but it was still an incredible experience. Summer is apparently the best time to spot dolphins, though, so I wonder what the average experience is like at other times of the year.
* Lunch at nearby [Kiyoka](https://maps.app.goo.gl/rxTs17qimZETStbD6). This felt like a hidden gem and was probably my favorite meal of the trip. Unassuming building but we strolled in without a reservation and were shown to a private tatami room. Felt very traditional, the waitresses even do the thing where they kneel before opening the sliding door, and the menu consisted of those set meals where there's like a sampling of twenty different things. I got the ""Ladies' Set"" (around 2000 yen and you don't have to be a lady lol) which had nigiri (tuna, shrimp, egg), sashimi (octopus, salmon, hamo, etc.), dengaku (my favorite), and more.
* Visit to the [Arima Christian Heritage Museum](https://maps.app.goo.gl/CGiuWbedEv6XyaWJA), a modest local place exhibiting the history of Christianity in Japan in connection with the local warlord Arima Harunobu, one of the daimyo converts, and Hara Castle, the site of a bloody 1637 rebellion where many of the rebels were Christians. I don't remember there being any English. They were selling products from local businesses, and we got some neat biscuits supposedly made according to a traditional recipe from Santa Maria Island in the Azores that the Portuguese missionaries brought over.
* Drove over to the [Hara Castle Ruins](https://maps.app.goo.gl/8RNLiPqJwRCxGouu7) but it seemed like there wasn't much to see and it was sweltering, so decided to just head back to Nagasaki. Stopped in Obama again, this time for delicious sorbet at [R cinq famille](https://maps.app.goo.gl/7eAkzn677eZCy5b9A).
* Casual dinner at [Asa made Udon](https://maps.app.goo.gl/o1hRUvDFYL3kK5hm7). Nothing special but we got to try Got–æÃÑ udon (hailing from the nearby Got–æÃÑ Islands), which is much thinner than your typical Sanuki udon.

Day 3 (Random City Stuff)

* Ate breakfast at [Cafe Hirai](https://maps.app.goo.gl/iJ2j4rtPfxmq9RCW6), an atmospheric little cafe serving hot sandwiches. I think I had the egg sandwich with a banana soy milk drink, both of which were good. One of the few non-fast food joints open early.
* Spent a couple hours in [Dejima](https://maps.app.goo.gl/C3frAyNoYDC38KZK8), the artificial island where all the Dutch traders were sequestered during the Edo period. It's now a sort of historical park with recreated buildings and plenty of informative exhibits. We did an hour-long guided tour (free). The guide was clearly pretty new and wasn't the best public speaker, but he was doing his best so I didn't mind. As a history nerd I could've easily spent more time there, but my friend had a work thing so before splitting up we grabbed Chinese for lunch at [Red Lantern](https://maps.app.goo.gl/GrA4QeAoRbXgtXQM7) inside the Dejima Wharf building. They of course had champon but I opted for congee, which was not bad.
* On my own, I headed to[ –ûÃÑura Cathedral](https://maps.app.goo.gl/QHStamWHKzNEqrrp7), one of the first churches built as Japan was opening up to the West and the oldest one still standing. There's not much to do inside the actual building but admire the architecture and listen to the spiel playing on the speakers (in Japanese). Most of your time will be spent in the adjacent museum introducing the history of Christianity in Japan. Of the three Christianity-related museums I visited, this one had the most noticeable Christian bent, whereas the other two had more of a neutral historical perspective.
* Walked around the nearby [Glover Garden](https://maps.app.goo.gl/3fh4B7rKkzEebhXU9), where you can tour the historic homes of prominent foreigners from the late 1800s. To be honest I thought this along with the –ûÃÑura Cathedral were skippable unless you have a particular interest in either, though admittedly I didn't go through the garden too thoroughly as it was very hot.
* Cooled off in my hotel before heading toward Mt. Inasa for the night view, eating dinner along the way at [Bibi Sushi](https://maps.app.goo.gl/AkKsvsFhZ1hJ5Hg9A), a revolving sushi place attached to a soccer stadium. Just walked in and it was pretty empty, but I assume that's because everyone was busy watching the game. Their specialties are local fish and fresh tuna that's never been frozen. You can never go wrong ordering the daily recommendations, which included fish I'd never seen before in Tokyo like *isaki*. They traditionally prefer white fish in Nagasaki, apparently. Everything was delicious, better than most revolving sushi places I've tried in Tokyo. I was alone and ate around 4000 yen worth, so the price is a step up from your Kura Sushi or Sushiro but so is the quality.
* Walked over to the cable car station and rode it to the [Mt. Inasa Overlook](https://maps.app.goo.gl/h29HFEn4CnhQ3nwT7). Honestly if I went again I'd just take a bus up to the top. It wasn't crowded when I went (around 7 p.m.) but I still had to wait a bit, only to be crammed into a small cable car with no air conditioning. Yes, the view is nice, but you're going to see the view at the top regardless. On my way down the line was enormous, which would definitely not be worth it. The view from the mountain is nice, though. Unfortunately there were bright lights on top of the viewing deck so you can't see many stars.

Day 4 (Sasebo)

* Took an early bus to the airport and from there rented a car with [Nippon Rent-A-Car](https://maps.app.goo.gl/1ExJJU7kyhZJ94N9A). I reserved online, so just had to go up to the rental car counter in the arrivals area and let them know I was there, then they sent someone to pick us up, as the actual rental shop is across the bridge.
* Drove up to Kujukushima (literally ""99 islands"") near Sasebo, which is part of the Saikai National Park. There we got on a [cruise ](https://maps.app.goo.gl/nkqWaJRH5wHmRF71A)to tour the scenic coastline. There were many options, the most basic of which was a large ship like the ""pirate"" ship at Hakone, but we chose the smaller boat which fits around 15 people. Didn't make a reservation as you have to do that by the previous afternoon but there was space, probably because it was a weekday. The guide explains things you see along the way, and the boat can enter small inlets that the large one can't, where we saw tiny jellyfish swimming around. According to our guide, sometimes there's even boar and deer swimming from island to island.
* Friend had an earlier flight so I dropped her off at the [Saihi bus terminal](https://maps.app.goo.gl/wTRtQyrRF9G4n3aU9) next to Sasebo Station, from which a bus bound directly for the airport departs, then tried a Sasebo burger, the local specialty owing to American influence from the naval base there, at [C&B Burgers](https://maps.app.goo.gl/jsVmBAQ9VEhoR6ve9). I'm not a huge burger person but it was worth a try.
* Headed back to Kujukushima and visited the [aquarium](https://maps.app.goo.gl/g42bz4Tk8iG7Lxeh9), which you get a small discount for if you show them your cruise ticket. Though small, it stood out to me precisely because it focuses on showcasing aquatic life from the surrounding area rather than just gathering popular and impressive species. There were also lots of cute handwritten notes by the staff. The big draws are the dolphin show (which they weren't running as the dolphins needed rest), sea turtles, and many species of local jellyfish.
* I had a lot of time to spare (flight wasn't until 9), so I took in some breathtaking views of the island-dotted coastline and the city with naval vessels going in and out of the harbor from [Tenkaiho ](https://maps.app.goo.gl/yAM4edBvLnCyk7un7)and [Yumiharidake](https://maps.app.goo.gl/55BLYukfsAjwUnDKA), just two of many observation decks in the area. The former was better for looking out over the islands, while the latter offered a better view of the city.
* Had my first pide (not a lot of Turkish food where I grew up) at [King's Kitchen](https://maps.app.goo.gl/G7PtDkZWoKw3ZGi89) before driving back to the airport. Owner was a funny guy. Everyone there was speaking English.

Overall, I loved Nagasaki and it's definitely one of my favorite destinations in Japan now. The two primary reasons I travel are to see history and nature, and it is top quality in both regards. In the future I hope to check out Hirado, the hot springs at Unzen, and maybe if I'm feeling adventurous, the Got–æÃÑ Islands or Tsushima.",https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1n4vqxs/trip_report_4_days_in_nagasaki/,"We loved Nagasaki, it's such an attractive city. So pleased you stopped in Obama Onsen, we stayed at a seafront ryokan there and it was a highlight of our Kyushu road trip. 

The history and culture of the entire Nagasaki prefecture is fascinating!

We visited the porcelain towns in Saga and planned to visit Sasebo but we ran out of time, sadly.","I'm planning to visit Nagasaki next time! I want to hit up Shiabara and Mount Unzen, would you say that renting a car like you did is recommended or can I just stick to public transit? In my research I've noticed overall that public transit on Kyushu isn't as convenient as big cities on the mainland (the routes are very segmented and everything seem to take a long time to get to).",Thanks for sharing. Brought back some memories. Nagasaki was a highlight during my kyushu trip. Champon and kakuni manju were interesting. Im chinese so the flavors were abit different to what im used to. Champon is like soupy seafood chow mein and the manju is like taiwanese ‚Äúhamburger‚Äù. I do recommend the castella cakes. It was very tasty. Nagasaki memoral museum was eye opening. Thing that i found haunting were the burned in shadows of victims. Suwa shrine has beautiful tori gates like in kyoto. No one was there when i went. Great hidden spot for photos. Some of the chinese temples in the hills such as kofukuji and sofukuji were serene and well kept.,"Thanks for posting.  I really liked Nagasaki, was not as adventerous as you with the car.",
1mtbzp5,"Travel Report - 3 week Japan Trip in Jul with Tokyo, Osaka, Kyoto and Expo","While planning for our own 3-week Jul 25 Japan trip recently, I found many of the commentary and advice from this reddit chain useful, so this is just my own contribution back as a travel report.

I‚Äôm a bit of a travel planning junkie so I wrote a 10,000 plus word trip record and kept a record of all spending transactions for this entire trip because I‚Äôm crazy - so I have a lot of details around the trip recorded. We travelled with a group of 70s, 50s and 20s. We stayed in AirBnb in Tokyo and Osaka mainly because we find that our AirBnb fitted our needs better than hotels as a large group of various age groups. We travel on a good value budget basis.

I am happy to answer any follow up questions. ¬†Here‚Äôs our itinerary

Day 1 Arrival - Arrived Sat night into Narita, used an airport transfer, and checked into our AirBnb

Day 2 Asakusa ‚Äì Dressed up for some folks, hung around Asakusa, attended the Tanabata (star festival) street festival on Kappanboshi street. Rested in the afternoon. Attended the Samurai Ninja Museum and shopped around Asakusa in the late evening.

Day 3 Harajuku & Shibuya - mainly shopping and visited the Cat alley

Day 4 Pokemon Caf√© and Ginza - best way to get reservations to Pokemon Caf√© turned out to be to check the night before at between 8.00 pm to 10.00 pm which we successfully did. This was only Japanese activity I failed to get a way advanced reservation despite actively trying before we arrive in Japan. Shopped in Ginza for clothing at Uniqlo flagship etc.

Day 5 Ghibli Museum ‚Äì travelled to Shirohige's Cream Puff Factory to get Ghibli theme food to set the mood and then to Ghibli Museum for noon entry. Izakaya dinner for everyone.

Day 6 Akihabara and Ikebukuro‚Äì rest day for some, rest did cosplay and anime shopping at Akihabara and Ikebukuro.

Day 7 Enoshima & Kamakura ‚Äì booked a day trip to Enoshima and Kamakura. At Enoshima, we visited the Imaya caves, then took the tram to Komachi Street. Visited the Tsurugaoka Hachmangu shrine and the Giant Buddha at Kamakura too.

Day 8 TeamLabs ‚Äì visited the Team Labs Borderless in the morning and spent some time at Aazbudai Hills food market and finished some late shopping in Akihabara.

Day 9 Travel to Osaka ‚Äì took the Shinkansen to Osaka and then checked into our AirBnb. Visited the Kuromon market and then had dinner at Shinsekai

Day 10 Osaka ‚Äì visited the Lion Head Namba Jika shrine, walked through the Namba area to get some food including the Rikuro cheesecake. Visited the Hezon-ji Temple before having a street food lunch at the Dontobori area, including taking photos of the Glico Man in a dedicated area. Then headed north to Americura for some second hand clothing shopping (a standout activity in Japan). Had the famous ice cream hot dog which was very above expectation. Ended at Pokemon Osaka in Shinsaibashi and then back to the AirbnB

Day 11 Kyoto & Arashiyama ‚Äì took an early local train to Arashiyama Bamboo Forest. Then climbed the Arashiyama Monkey Park before having lunch at the Arashiyama Rilakkuma Caf√©. Took cabs to Kinkaku-ji (Golden Pavilion). Then took cabs to our hotel in Kyoto for our 2 night stay. Attended the evening performance at Gion Corner.

Day 12 Kyoto ‚Äì after breakfast headed to Kiyomizu-dera. Then walked to Kodai-ji temple. Next walked past the Maruyama Park before ending up at Yasaka temple. We then had lunch, visited the Nisihiki market, had a brief stop at Pokemon Kyoto and finally visited the Museum of Kyoto. For dinner we visited the food street market for Gion Matsuri (the Kyoto Summer festival).

Day 13 Kyoto ‚Äì attended the Gion Matsuri parade though it rained heavily all day which dampened down the festivities. After lunch we took the local train back to our Airbnb in Osaka.

Day 14 Osaka Expo Day ‚Äì We planned and scenario built Osaka Expo extensively via Excel of course, it‚Äôs not an activity I would recommend to just rock up without planning. We left early to get to our 9.00 am entry, but only managed to get in around 9.40 am. For myself I ended up doing this in sequence (with no real successful reservations that day). Japan Pavilion ‚Äì> German Pavilion -> South Korean Pavilion -> Singapore Pavilion -> Hungary Pavilion -> Oman Pavilion -> Qatar Pavilion -> UAE Pavilion -> Day Time Water Show -> Future City Pavilion -> Spain Pavilion -> Earth At Night Pavilion -> Malaysia Pavilion -> Night Water Show -> Drone Show -> Swiss Pavilion. Some of our group did less, one of our group did 5+ more. Main ones I did different from the others were the Australia Pavilion and the China Pavilion, while I tried 3-4 times unsuccessfully to get same day reservations at kiosk.

Day 15 Nara ‚Äì Slower pace day to recover from Osaka Expo Day. Took the train to Nara and visited the Kofuuji Temple and the surrounding complex. Then spend a bit of time at Nara Deer Park feeding the deer. Took a short break at the free Yoshikien Garden before heading to the lantern centric Kasuga Taisha Shrine. We skipped the Todai-ji shrine. Then headed back to the Airbnb.

Day 16 Miyajima & Hiroshima ‚Äì took the shinkansen to Hiroshima and then the local ferry across to Miyajima island. Walked to the Itsukushima Torii gates (it was low tide), then visited the Daisho-in temple. Got some exclusive Rilakkuma merchandise at the Omotesand≈ç Shopping Street. Then had a Anago lunch with fried oysters. Both Anago (Sea eel) and Oysters are good food to try out at the island. Then took a direct ferry back to Hiroshima and visited the Hiroshima Peace Museum, the Memorial Park and the Dome. Then visited the Pokemon Hiroshima Center at the Hiroshima station before heading back to the Airbnb

Day 17 Ghibli Park Day ‚Äì took an early Shinkansen to Nagoya and then two local trains Ghibli Park. One of us is a huge studio Ghibli park fan so this was a must do in Japan .We had the premium tickets so did all the park related activity, lots of photos were taken that day ‚Äì more details can be shared. And then took the long 3 hour journey home when the park is nearly closed. Others who didn‚Äôt join us visited the Osaka Castle instead.

Day 18 Himeji & Kobe ‚Äì we took a Shinkansen to Himeiji Castle and spent a couple of hours there before taking another Shinkansen to Kobe for lunch at the Kobe Steakland. Then we walked around Kobe Chinatown a bit before heading back to Osaka for dinner at the Namba area.

Day 19 Universal Studios Japan ‚Äì some of us were keen to visit Super Nintendo World, so we left early. Official opening hour that day was 8.30 am but it opened at 8.00 (that's normal and expected) and we ended up at Super Nintendo World by 8.10 am without any Fast pass or the like. The most ambitious of our group managed to get onto the following rides all before 2.00 pm, in roughly this order. Mario Kart -> The Flying Dinosaur (multiple times that day) -> Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey -> Hollywood Dreams -> Jurassic Park -> Jaws -> Minion Mayhem -> Spy X Family XR Ride ->¬† Flight of the Hippogriff. Basically every thrill ride except for the new Donkey Kong Ride (which had a 3 hour wait time by 8.30 am!). We also did all the decent shows like Waterworld, Dorameon 4D, Sing and the Monster Rock mostly a good choice to hide from the heat. We finished and left the park around 6.00 pm.

Day 20 Osaka -> last full day for us in Osaka, so after we arranged for some luggage to ship to our Tokyo hotel, I ended up at the Shitennoji Temple to get a taste of the Tenjin Matsuri. Also walked the tenshindori-suji arcade shop which had at least a dozen temple carrying parades go through there in preparation of the following day‚Äôs proper Matsuri Tenjin which we will miss. Then back to Airbnb for our journey back to Tokyo. Had a sukiyaki dinner.

Day 21 Tokyo -> arrive via Shinkanesen in the morning to check into our Tokyo hotel next to the Tokyo Station. Did some last minute shopping around the area and a sushi dinner.

Day 22 Last day in Japan -> Headed to Ueno to visit the Tokyo National Museum, then off to Narita airport and getting last minute exclusive Pokemons from Narita Airport for our evening flight out of Japan.

This ended our 3 week holiday in Japan. Most days we started early but finished not too late in light of the age and fitness of our group. I built in some flexibility in our schedule (despite what it seems from the itinerary above) and we were not too stressed if we missed out certain activities. We treated the heat in July with respect but it wasn‚Äôt an impossible challenge.

If you have any questions or thoughts, I am happy to help and respond to them.

1n44c5m,"12 Night Itinerary for a First Timer (Tokyo, Hakone, Osaka, Kyoto) for Your Review","After years of saying Japan is a bucket list destination for me, I finally realised there was nothing stopping me from just doing it. Think I kept putting it off because I was thinking I had to do it just right.. but really, I just have to do it. So here we go..

I've researched other people's itineraries on here (thanks everyone for sharing), and here's what I came up with for **March 2026**. Reasons for my choices: I want to hit up the iconic spots, with more of a lean towards nature and food (duh). Hope it's feasible without being overwhelming and makes geographical sense, so please let me know. I decided to split my time in Tokyo to spread the sensory overload and mainly so I wasn't getting a train on my last day. Because of this, I'm also open to changing Hakone to being on the way back to Tokyo from Kyoto, for some R&R. But also like the appeal of using it to revive myself from potential jetlag to prepare for the meat of the trip. All feedback welcome!

Ok kind folks of Reddit, lemme have it!",https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1n44c5m/12_night_itinerary_for_a_first_timer_tokyo_hakone/,"On Day 10: When are you going to be in Kyoto? If it‚Äôs not during cherry blossom season, I would consider skipping Kaege Incline and going straight to Ginkaku-ji instead of Kinkaku-ji, walking south on Philosopher‚Äôs Path from there. It also ends near Nanzen-ji.

Day 7: We did a 45-minute tea ceremony at Camellia Flower, which is right on Ninenzaka.

If Kinkaku-ji is a must-do, I would consider taking a cab there after Tenryu-ji on Day 9. Camellia also has a tea ceremony they do around Ryoan-ji/Kinkaku-ji called ‚ÄúGarden‚Äù instead of ‚ÄúFlower‚Äù if you want to do the tea ceremony on Day 9 before heading to Kinkaku-ji (note it closes at 5pm and will be incredibly crowded in the afternoon).

Edit: I had one more thought to help avoid crowds at Kinkaku-ji! Do it first thing in the morning on Day 10, take a cab straight to the north entrance of Philosopher‚Äôs Path (which is right near Ginkaku-ji), and then wander down Philosopher‚Äôs Path towards Nanzen-ji.

You should do Samurai Restaurant Time when you‚Äôre in Shinjuku on Day 2 before wandering the area (I‚Äôm pretty sure dinner is included)!"," Congrats!, you have created a refreshingly sane itenerary. Kind of a rarity in these parts.","Nothing more to add, but just a heads up in case you didn‚Äôt know‚Äî most shops and restaurants only open at 11am. Plan your schedule with that in mind. Good luck and enjoy your trip!","Checkout the hakone free pass. 6100 yen return trip to Tokyo and gives you free multi use access to the hakone buses, boat, chair lifts, and mountain train. There‚Äôs a two consecutive day one for a little less. 
I explored/hiked during the day and used the hot springs at night. 

K‚Äôs house hostel is pretty decent and has onsen included.",
1n88bao,18 day August trip report!,"Hi all! As a way of saying thanks to everyone on this sub I'm posting a ""quick"" report on our 18 day trip. Me and my gf, both mid thirties from Italy. Hope you find it useful, feel free to ask any questions!

* **Mon 11:** arrival at Fukuoka late afternoon, quick stroll along the river and dinner at yatai, there were only a few even though it was a national holiday. Ok ramen, great grilled mentaiko!
* **Tue 12:** shinkansen to Hiroshima, train to Miyajima. Itsukushima shrine, then mt Misen then Daishoin. Train back to Hiroshima to see the atom dome, okonomiyaki dinner and train to Onomichi. Quick stroll to see Onomichi temples from outside at night.
* **Wed 13:** Shimanami Kaido to Imabari. We stopped at Kosanji and did a detour to Oyamazumi shrine, plus a quick swim. Get the electric bikes if you want to see more stuff, and use them on max! Yakiniku at Imabari near the station for dinner.
* **Thu 14:** Train to Matsuyama. Matsuyama castle via the Ninomaru (on foot) then took the ropeway down, then Dogo Onsen tour and private bath at the annex. Wanted to see the cave tunnel at Ishiteji but it closes at 16:00 so we missed it. Train to Marugame, izakaya dinner since it was late, great udon!
* **Fri 15:** we decided against getting up super early to go to Kotohira and instead went directly to Takamatsu. Visited Ritsurin without rushing, then train to Tokushima for Awa Odori. Amazing experience. We had tickets for the show at Sansan at 20.20, so much fun. Stayed at an AirBnB (only place available when we booked).
* **Sat 16:** early train to Takamatsu then Okayama. Stopped for Korakuen. Train to Himeji, managed to get a spot on the official english tour at 13. Then onwards to Osaka, after checking in we headed to Dotonbori.
* **Sun 17:** train towards Nara, stopping first at Horyuji and then Yakushiji and Toshodaiji. Check in at Nara just before seeing the sunset in the park in front of the museum. After dark we walked to the gate at Todaiji, seeing the kongorikishi lit up at night alone was great!
* **Mon 18:** Todaiji, Kasugataisha, Kofukuji for the museum (fantastic statues!) because obviously the pagoda is under renovation, then the free machiya at Naramachi Nigiwai-no-le. Around 8 pm we took the train to Kyoto, checked in, then went to see the last day of illumination at Kodaiji.
* **Tue 19:** early start at Kinkakuji, then Ryoanji. Then Arashiyami, bamboo grove and Senryuji. Then ukai cormorant fishing, awesome! Dinner at an izakaya in pontocho.
* **Wed 20:** first Toji since it was near our hotel, then Nijojo. Nishiki market afterwards. In the afternoon Kiyomizudera for the sunset, walk through Higashiyama and Gion, then kawayuka dinner.
* **Thu 21:** Toji once again since we learned of the huge flea market held on the 21st of each month. Then Nishi and Higashi Honganji. The huge gate at Higashi was open so we climbed it. Afterwards we took a train to Uji for Byodoin, then crossed the river for Ujikami shrine, and took the Keihan train to Fushimi for sake tasting. After that we got to Fushimi Inari a bit after sunset, and climbed to the top at night with way less crowds. Yakitori for dinner.
* **Fri 22:** last day in Kyoto, we were missing some of the main attractions (imperial palace gardens, Ginkakuji, Heian...) but we decided to escape the crowds and the heat and went north for the Kurama-Kibune hike. We even managed to get a spot at the nagashi somen kawadoko place! In the afternoon back to Higashiyama for Sanjusanjendo and the national museum, which closes at 20 on fridays. For our last meal in Kyoto we found a minuscule obanzai restaurant (literally just someone's kitchen).
* **Sat 23:** train back to Osaka to catch the Nankai express for Koyasan. Okunoin in the morning, fire ceremony, check in at Kongo Sanmain, and then in the afternoon we just had time for the museum before everything closed. Back to the shukubo for dinner (delicious shojin ryori!) then a night stroll at Okunoin again. We didn't do the guided tour, too expensive and with so many people it would have lost all the atmosphere.
* **Sun 24:** morning ceremony, breakfast, then Kongobuji, Tokugawa Mausoleum and the other sights. Took the train back to Osaka in the early afternoon since we had an helicopter ride booked to see the Daisenryo Kofun (mindblowing!). Then shinkansen to Tokyo. After check in, we managed to see Sensoji lit up.
* **Mon 25:** day trip to Nikko. Rinnoji, Toshogu, Futarasan, Taiyuin and Kanmangafuchi Abyss. Simply amazing. Quick outing at Shibuya to see the scramble when we got back to Tokyo.
* **Tue 26:** train to Yamanashi for wine tasting at Katsunuma Winery. Then back to Otsu to take the train for mt Fuji, and the Fujiyoshida fire festival. One of the most amazing experiences in the whole trip.
* **Wed 27:** from Fuji directly to Kamakura. Kotokuin, Hasedera, and Tsurugaoka. We could have done more temples but we decided to take it easy and managed to go to the beach for a bit. Back to Tokyo for the night.
* **Thu 28:** Sumo exhibition tour at Tachikawa. So much fun, 6 hours went by so fast! In the afternoon Meiji Jingu, a bit of shopping at Shibuya, then managed to see the fireworks at Ota City.
* **Fri 29:** last day in Japan, breakfast at Tsukiji market, then the national museum. Flight back home in the late afternoon.

All in all... fantastic trip! First time in Japan for both of us. Spent around 3500‚Ç¨-4000‚Ç¨ each including flights and everything.

Notes: the heat in august is no joke. Be sure to keep hydrated... pocari sweat FTW! Also, we used waaay more cash than we expected. Everywhere we read online said card was accepted 99% of the time... well not really. Luckily withdrawing in yen at the 7/11 ATM was easy and cheap (commissions-wise).

Thanks for reading!",https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1n88bao/18_day_august_trip_report/,Thanks for sharing! Any restaurants you particularly loved in Kyoto? We‚Äôre going at the end of the month.,"That was a fast ride on the Shimanami Kaido. I think we will take two days and stop over the night to visit Rabbit Island, then ride the bikes to Imabari and spend the second night halfway. 

You are planning the exact same thing as we are. Going to Miyajima and climbing Mt Misen and returning to Hiroshima and then to Onomichi. That itself seems like alot for one day, or did you just take the lift to the top of Mt Misen?

I'm skipping Koyasan, but apparently it seems there are new trains and its much easier to get to then when I planned this trip 5 years ago!  It is still prohibitively expensive though.

Your trip is really a whirlwind. From one hotel to the next every night. I want to go slower on this one unlike my European trips.",Wow! Sounds like an amazing trip :) I have a question about your time in Hiroshima/Ehime for sightseeing-did you feel like you had enough time there? I'm currently planning my trip and want to feel like I have time to explore a little.,How was Dogo Onsen and how do you book a private bath? I‚Äôm going to do Shimanami Kaido in November and was considering if Dogo Onsen is worth checking out at the end.,

EDIT: Thanks to everyone!",https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1mo2r78/15_days_in_japan_tokyo_nikko_kamakura_kyoto/,"I can't say I'm an expert on Japan travel but a few things stood out to me:
- If you guys love animanga stuff and plan to shop for merch, 3 hours in Akihabara is way too little. I'd recommend a full day.
- Your plan for Shinjuku feels off imo. Golden gai and Omoide Yokocho are izakaya spots which typically starts coming alive in the evening. Kabukicho too. And 13.30-15.30 feels way too short to hit all of them.
- Kaminarimon/Senso-ji can get pretty crowded, you might want to go earlier in the morning, or at least spend more time in the sidewalks, where there's actually some pretty nice street food (karaage, melon pan etc)

I can't comment much on Kyoto because I never stayed there.

The train timings in Nikko are much less frequent than the major cities so you might want to have some leeway/be less strict with the timings.","Let's see what stands out to me:

Day 1 arrival and time to get TO lunch is probably ok.  Depending on what you choose for lunch, you may not get to your check-in by 16:00.  Will probably be ok though as you can just take the train to Tokyo station, find something in the food court downstairs OR go outside and walk towards your accomodation and eat nearby.  Be aware Tokyo station is massive and easy to get lost in, so it can be a time sink if you're not already familiar with the layout.

Day 2 is nuts.  Not a chance you're going to squeeze in all of that stuff from 13:30 on, and still make it on the subway to your TeamLabs appointment

Day 1 in Kyoto - not a chance you're going to see all those temples.  Consider travel time on busses and subways and walking time.

Day 2 in Kyoto - you probably want more time at Fushimi Inari Taisha unless you just want to see them and turn around and do something else.  If you plan to hike to the top, you need a couple more hours.","Stay away from the street carts if those are what you're considering.

You seem to have an awful little time for most of the things you're planning to do. Our family, for example, took a trip to a (very) small museum yesterday and looked at two exhibits with a total length of perhaps 100 meters, and it took about two hours. Getting to and from the exhibition to another two hours.

It's not clear where this notion of 'street food' comes from. Japan doesn't really have it.",This seems too much. I‚Äôd take out a few things from each day to actually enjoy a few things,
1n0rrvh,Trip Report: 3.5 Weeks Central Honshu between Kyoto and Tokyo (Summer 2025),"We just returned from a 3.5 week trip from mid-July to mid-August that started in Kyoto and ended in Tokyo. Since we have been to Japan before, we decided to focus on off-the-beaten-path destinations in the central Honshu / Japanese Alps between Tokyo and Kyoto.

Each of these central Honshu destinations are historic towns with authentic experiences around culture, scenery, food and nature that were unique contrasts to those we‚Äôve experienced previously in the Golden Route cities.

Our itinerary was as follows:

1. Fly into KIX (Osaka)
2. **Kyoto**, with day trips to **Nara**, **Asuka** and **Uji** (7 nights total)
3. **Nakatsugawa** as a base for Kiso Valley highlights: **Nakansendo Trail** and **Atera Valley** (3 nights)
4. **Matsumoto** (3 nights)
5. **Hirayu Onsen**, with **Kamikochi** day (1 night)
6. **Takayama** (3 nights)
7. **Shirakawa-go** (day trip going from Takayama to Kanazawa)
8. **Kanazawa** (3 nights)
9. **Nagano** (2 nights)
10. **Tokyo** (2 nights) , Fly out of NRT

‚Ä¢	‚Å†***Kyoto***: I have been twice before while it was first time for my family. We focused on key highlights by area:

* East side: Philosopher's Path to Kiyomizu-dera
* Northwest: Kinkakuji and Ryoanji
* Northeast: Kurama-dera hike to Kifune Shrine
* West: Arashiyama full day, with a stop at Koryuji, the oldest temple in Kyoto which displays National Treasure No. 1 Bodhisattva statue

Also had a great time exploring different neighborhoods, local restaurants and Kamo river by bike, which is one of the best ways to explore the city.

Kyoto‚Äôs famed Gion Festival was also in full swing towards last few weeks of July, so we saw giant traditional floats and locals in mini-parades going through main streets.

***Overnight / Day Trips from Kyoto:***

**Nara** (overnight trip): We were impressed with Horyuji, the oldest extant wooden building complex in the world and a UNESCO world heritage site. We also explored the Nara Deer Park area.

**Asuka:** was an amazing day exploring rural landscapes (‚ÄúMy Neighbor Totoro‚Äù style) which I wrote about in a separate post (please check my profile).

**Uji**: Enjoyed matcha tasting, bought some high quality Uji matcha, and explored Byodo-in, one of Japan‚Äôs most scenic temples that is on the 10 yen coin (and you can also see the replica temple in Oahu, Hawaii). We also caught a riverside demonstration of nighttime cormorant fishing using live fire.

***Kiso Valley Highlights:***

From Kyoto, we traveled to ***Nakatsugawa***, a compact town that is a great base for day trips to two ***Kiso Valley*** highlights below:

‚Ä¢	‚Å†***Nakasendo Trail*** *between* ***Magome and Tsumago (day trip)***: I did a separate post about this iconic section of the Edo-era route (check my profile). This route connects two of the most beautiful Edo-period post towns **Magome-juku** and **Tsumago-juku** and was used by feudal lords and their entourage, merchants, pilgrims and travelers during 1600s-1870s.

From Nakatsugawa, we took a 25 min. bus ride to Magome-juku, which we explored and where we ate local soba for lunch. We then had an amazing three hour hike, passing through majestic cedar forests, waterfalls and beautiful rice paddies. We explored Tsumago briefly, then took a short bus ride to Nagiso Station, then returned by train to our hotel in Nakatsugawa.

‚Ä¢	‚Å†***Atera Valley (day trip)***: We had an awesome day exploring what the Japanese call ‚ÄúAtera Blue‚Äù -- stunning turquoise blue, emerald green swimming holes along a crystal clear river. We spent the full day exploring this river, stopping at various spots to swim, dive, and just soak in the spectacular scenery in cool, lush surroundings. You can see some of my pictures from this day in a separate post (check my profile).

From Nakatsugawa, we took the train north to Matsumoto where we stayed 3 nights:

‚Ä¢	‚Å†***Matsumoto***: This is a charming, compact town famous for a beautifully preserved castle with original interior (unique as many castles have refurbished modern interiors). We really loved this ""human scale"" town with its super chill, local vibe and great museums including art from Matsumoto-born Yayoi Kusama.

From Matsumoto, we took the reserved bus further into the Japanese Alps for Hirayu Onsen and Kamikochi:

‚Ä¢	***‚Å†Hirayu Onsen***: Located halfway between Matsumoto and Takayama, Hirayu Onsen is one of many onsen villages that comprise the **Okuhida Onsen** area, known for open air hot springs with mountain/river views. We stayed at a nice historic ryokan that had several open air hot springs baths, a multi-course kaiseki dinner featuring local Hida wagyu cooked over irori fire pits, and an amazing breakfast. This is a good spot to overnight before/after Kamikochi visit.

‚Ä¢	***‚Å†Kamikochi (day trip)***: After checking out of our ryokan, we went to the Hirayu Onsen bus depot, where you can catch the buses to Kamikochi, considered one of Japan‚Äôs most beautiful nature spots. This is a stunning alpine valley in the Japanese Alps, and it was a perfect easy hike / walking day in a spectacular nature setting. You can also visit Kamikochi as a day trip from either Matsumoto or Takayama, (or on your way between these towns).

At the end of the Kamikochi day, we took the bus to Takayama, where we stayed 3 nights:

‚Ä¢	***‚Å†Takayama***: This is a picturesque Edo-era mountain town. When we arrived, there was a weekend night market, live music performances on the street, and fireworks, so it was quite nice to join the locals who were out and about enjoying themselves. We loved biking around the traditional wooden merchant houses, checking out morning markets, and visiting Hida folk village. The main river that runs through the town is filled with carp, a beautiful scene. We also ate Hida wagyu, the local beef that this region (Hida) is famous for.

‚Ä¢	**Hida Furukawa (half day trip)**: A pleasant half day to a small town north of Takayama which is known for carp-filled canals, sake breweries, and as the inspiration for the fictional town in the hit anime movie *Your Name* (Âêõ„ÅÆÂêç„ÅØ, Kimi no Na wa). 

From Takayama, we headed to Kanazawa via a day trip to Shirakawa-go:

‚Ä¢	‚Å†***Shirakawa-go (day trip)***: This is a super scenic Hida mountain village (UNESCO world heritage) famed for iconic gassho-zukuri farmhouses found in the Hida region. This village is beautiful in all seasons, particularly in winter when it is decked out in snow. This village can be done as a day trip from either (or between) Kanazawa and Takayama, 1-1.5 hr bus ride each way.

After your day trip to Shirakawa-go, you can continue by bus to Kanazawa:

‚Ä¢	‚Å†***Kanazawa*** is a special town that rivaled Kyoto and Edo (Tokyo) as a cultural hub during Edo period as the base of the Maeda clan, the second most powerful after the ruling Tokugawa clan.

We visited the stunning Kenrokuen, one of Japan‚Äôs ‚Äúthree most beautiful gardens‚Äù; explored the castle complex, samurai villas and geisha chaya district, and also checked out some great modern museums (21st Century Museum of Contemporary Art and DT Suzuki museum). You can also shop for traditional crafts among numerous shops in Kanazawa. We also had amazing seafood and Omicho market in a good spot to try them.

From Kanazawa, we took the Shinkansen clockwise to Nagano, taking a bit over an hour.

‚Ä¢	***‚Å†Nagano***: We visited the historic Zenkoji temple, around which the city of Nagao grew. There is a great shopping / dining street that leads up to the temple. We bought a variety of shichimi spices from the famous Yawataya Isogoro shop, which has been selling their shichimi here since 1736. We also had a great day trip to Togakushi Shrine, a mountain area with truly majestic cedar-lined pilgrimage road that links 3 key shrines associated with earliest Japanese mythologies. We had a great lunch at a local soba restaurant and spend our day leisurely hiking in the cool forest paths. There is a Ninja museum as well, although we did not have time to visit this.

From Nagano, we headed to Tokyo by 1.5 hr Shinkansen.

‚Ä¢	***‚Å†Tokyo***: We have visited Tokyo many times, so we only spent 2 nights before our flight out. We enjoyed sushi omakase, explored the neighborhoods around Nippori Station, teamlabs Borderless and Tokyo National Museum. We had an amazing Anago lunch set at a restaurant called Anago Tamai (Nihonbashi main branch) before our train to Narita airport.



**\*\*\*Japan Tips & Recommendations\*\*\***

I will skip the usual stuff about adding Suica to your phone, etc. and add some nuance:

**Tip #1:** It‚Äôs essential to **‚Äúgo with the flow‚Äù of existing train/bus routes** when planning itineraries.  Avoid trying to do crazy connections that will require multiple transfers and eat up most of your valuable travel day, e.g. ""I want to go from Takayama to Nakasendo Trail"". These spots look relatively close on a map, but they are actually separated by towering Japanese Alps mountains which means you‚Äôd need to do a big V route along train lines that only radiate out from Nagoya. 

Similarly, Matsumoto could be 3-6 hours from Tokyo by car or train/bus combo, but only 2 hrs and 20 min if you go via Nagano (due to Shinkansen from Tokyo). So it would only be natural to consider adding Nagano in your itinerary even if you were just interested in Matsumoto for Kamikochi at first. 

**Tip #1a**: Use [japan-guide.com](http://japan-guide.com) and check ""Get There"" section -- this lists all the usual logistics options to access and get around any given location.

**Tip #1b**: **Choose local, slower trains vs reserved faster trains, whenever sensible**: Often the time difference is not meaningful, local trains could be 30-60% cheaper, and you don't need to stress about making specific trains /seats or waste time with station machines / people. Google Maps shows the different options and prices.

**Tip #1c**: **Bus:** Check online for published bus schedules between Matsumoto - Kamikochi/Hirayu Onsen - Takayama - Shirakawa-go - Kanazawa routes. **Alpico** (originating from Matsumoto) and **Nohi** (originating from Takayama).

There are frequent buses that connect these spots, but some legs require reservations beforehand. Fortunately, you can reserve these easily online (starting a month beforehand) and use mobile QR tickets to get on/off these reserved buses. 

Many legs don't require reservations and are typically bought same day -- for example, Kamikochi / Hirayu Onsen to Takayama is bought same day. If there are too many people, the Nohi bus company just sends another bus to accommodate everyone.

**Tip #2**: **Bring cash and coins to these parts.** You can use Suica and credit cards in the big cities, but cash is essential in areas like Kiso Valley and Kamikochi -- many stations here (even JR lines) do NOT take Suica or credit cards. Often these small stations don't even have turnstiles - you just get on trains freely and someone pops out at your destination to collect cash/coins from you. Many restaurants only take cash. In Hirayu / Kamikochi, there are no ATMs available.

**Tip #3:** **Pack light!** One carry-on and a backpack per person makes life so much easier. Try to arrange hotels or Airbnbs with washer/dryers at least every 4-5 days (and most hotels have coin operated washer/dryers).

**Tip #3a**: **Bring a simple collapsible bag** to use at the end for shopping. We still brought back boxes of sneakers, clothes, food souvenirs, personal care goods, kitchen tools, etc., mostly purchased towards the end of our itinerary.

**Tip #4**: **Restaurant Reservations**: We had some amazing meals throughout our trip, but did not stress out about reservations at all. The only reservations we made were for two sushi omakase meals in Kyoto (Sushi Iwata a few days beforehand via Instagram) and Tokyo (Manten Sushi on their website via Tablecheck). 

The rest were just walk-ins, or rarely last minute reservations when we got to the city. For example, we had two of our best dinners of our trip in Nakatsugawa, including Waraidokoro Airo (Á¨ëÂá¶ „ÅÇ„ÅÑ„Çç), an obanzai place run by two smiling ladies, and Shabu Shabu Aoyagi (Âøó„ÇÉ„Å∂„Åó„ÇÉ„Å∂ ÈùíÊü≥), a counter-only place run by an elderly couple. Both are limited capacity restaurants, so we simply made a reservation once we got to Nakatsugawa. For Airo I just walked over before dinner service started to ask for a table an hour later; for Aoyagi, they initially turned us away, so I made a reservation for the following night.",https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1n0rrvh/trip_report_35_weeks_central_honshu_between_kyoto/,"Forget rude people OP, I appreciate your write up. I'm taking my mom in a couple of months so we won't be moving around too much especially on foot but this itinerary sounds like something I'd do on another trip, so I'm bookmarking it for next time.¬†


Did you forward luggage or did you backpack your way entirely? Are buses/trains frequent or did you have to be mindful of days/hours of operation between these smaller towns?",Some opinions on what you liked the most/didn‚Äôt like would‚Äôve been a lot more useful than just stating what you did.¬†,,,

What do you think? Is it doable?

Thank you ",https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1mxn0ms/21_days_is_this_doable/,You will save an entire day by putting all of your Tokyo at the end of the trip and instead getting the Shinkansen down to Osaka straight away. Travel days suck and if you can have less of them that means you can do more things!,"This is your 1st trip to Japan?

It's a very detailed itinerary! Is this your normal habit In daily life? If it's what you're comfortable with, it's intense but you do you.

Just a suggestion but maybe open up some space for randomness and adventure.

Create some larger project-style dreams rather than location checklists. It'll help your photography by shifting your mindset. Open up space to visually listen and respond to what you experience. Let the camera shutter follow life's experiences.

Have a beautiful trip.","Definitely don‚Äôt think this is even possible. Day 3 is going to tire you out and then multiple day trips within succession of each other is just so much travelling within a short amount of time, I‚Äôd half almost everything on each day","I just got back from a 21 day trip hitting the same cities you will.¬†

Some of your packed days are doable in the beginning, but as the trip goes on you slowly lose more and more energy and wake up later. That‚Äôs life. My one thing I did that I recommend was starting off the trip with Kansai (Kyoto, Osaka, Hiroshima) because there are more attractions there, particularly in Kyoto where waking up early and having more energy to see all the temples is more ideal than in Tokyo.¬†",
1moek8k,Trip report: Second trip in february/march 2025,"Here is my trip report from our second trip to Japan! 

  
We are a couple in our 30's from Europe and we are already planning our third trip for this fall. 

# Tokyo (4 nights, 3 days)

* Ghibli Museum
* Nakano Broadway
* Akihabara
* Shibuya
* Harajuku
* Korean Town in Shin-Okubo
* Pok√©mon Center DX in Nihonbashi
* Daytrip to Yokohama

We stayed in **Ginza**, near a smaller metro station ‚Äì something I recommend, as it‚Äôs much easier to navigate than the big ones. For transportation in Tokyo we bought a **72-hour metro pass**, which was very convenient. JR lines aren‚Äôt included, but we only needed one JR ride during our stay.

We also took a **day trip to Yokohama**, where we visited Chinatown, the strawberry festival, and the Pok√©mon Center in Marui City Yokohama. The mall also had a large second-hand store full of Pok√©mon plushies, and I even won a big Chansey in a claw machine. Chinatown‚Äôs food was a bit underwhelming for me ‚Äì but that might be because I‚Äôd visited China just a few months earlier, so my expectations were fresh and high.

# Kawaguchiko (2 nights, 2 days)

* Chureito Pagoda
* Oishi Park
* Lake Yamanaka
* Gotemba Premium Outlets
* Oshino Hakkai

We took the bus to **Kawaguchiko** (the only bus/train we pre-booked during the trip), checked into our hotel, and explored Fuji-Q Highland in the afternoon. We really liked this park, it was chill and took many pictures at Naruto x Boruto hidden village of Konoha. In the evening, we picked up a rental car from **Budget Rent** ‚Äì a great experience ‚Äì so we could start early the next morning.

Visiting **Chureito Pagoda** at 8 am was perfect: almost no one there, and Mt Fuji was crystal clear. We also visited a nearby waterfall, Oishi Park, and peaceful Lake Yamanaka, where we enjoyed fluffy pancakes at *The Park* caf√© (only a 10-minute wait).

Later we drove to **Gotemba Premium Outlets**, where we bought an exclusive Mt Fuji Pikachu and some sneakers, then stopped at **Oshino Hakkai**, a traditional village with beautiful clear ponds. It was a bit touristy, but still charming. We were lucky to have Mt Fuji visible both days, and having a car made visiting all these spots much easier.

# Nagano (2 nights, 2,5 days)

* Jigokudani Monkey Park
* Togakushi Shrine Okusha (Main Shrine) Zuishinmon

We took the shinkansen to **Nagano** (about 4 hours) and had a relaxing evening. The next day we visited **Jigokudani Monkey Park** ‚Äì the snow monkeys were amazing, and the hike there was fun (but icy, so wear good shoes). In the evening, we enjoyed Korean BBQ and games at *Round 1*.

The following day we took the bus to **Togakushi Shrine Okusha**, where the cedar trees were stunning. It‚Äôs worth seeing if you have time, but skippable if you‚Äôre on a tight schedule. That evening we took the train to Kanazawa.

Nagano the city was pretty dull, so I wouldn't go back here anytime soon.

# Kanazawa (2 nights, 1,5 day)

* Omicho Market
* Nagamachi Samurai District
* Ishiura Shrine
* Higashi Chaya District
* Pokemon centre

We started at Omicho market, which I loved. I ate a croquette there and then went upstairs. On the second floor there are many restaurants so you can sit down for a nice meal. I had the best kaisendon here.

It rained all day, so we skipped Kenroku-en Garden. There‚Äôs a bus connecting al the touristic spots, but we walked everywhere (about 20 minutes between each). We enjoyed snacks along the way, and even with the rain, Kanazawa was beautiful ‚Äì I‚Äôll definitely return.

# Fukui (1 day)

* Fukui Dinosaur Museum
* Echizen Daibutsu

From Kanazawa, we took the train to **Fukui**. The Dinosaur Museum and Echizen Daibutsu were fantastic. Looking back, I wish we had rented a car here ‚Äì public transport was slow and infrequent, so we couldn‚Äôt fit much else in. In the evening, we took the train to Kyoto.

# Kyoto (4 nights, 3 days)

* Nintendo Museum (Uji)
* Tenjuan Temple
* Nanzenji Suirokaku
* Kyoto City KYOCERA Museum of Art

In Kyoto we took a trip to **Uji** to visit the new Nintendo Museum. Loved just strolling around Uji, it's peacefull and charming.

The next day we bought an unlimited **bus & metro pass** at Kyoto Station, which made getting around easy. we explored several temples and sights such as **Tenjuan Temple**, **Nanzenji Suirokaku**, and the **KYOCERA Museum of Art** ‚Äì this part of the city was almost tourist-free, which made it even better.  Our last day, we had planned to drive to **Amanohashidate**, but rain was forecast, so we opted for a relaxed day in Kyoto eating and shopping.

# Hotel booking tips

I mostly book hotels through Trip and Agoda ‚Äì Booking isn‚Äôt always the cheapest in Asian countries. I always choose free cancellation, book at least 4 months in advance, and check weekly if prices drop. This approach gets us the best deals. On our first trip we stayed in pricier hotels, but this time we got equally good (or better) ones for less.

# Total trip cost ‚Äì 2 weeks, 2 people (from Europe)

**‚Ç¨4,050** total (excluding shopping)

* Flights: ‚Ç¨1,357
* Accommodation (twin rooms): ‚Ç¨811 (‚Ç¨54/night on average)
* Transport (trains, metros, buses, car rental): ‚Ç¨677
* Activities (entry tickets, etc.): ‚Ç¨150
* Food: ‚Ç¨1,120 (‚Ç¨80/day on average)
* Shopping: ‚Ç¨900 (games, clothing, anime figures, Pok√©mon plush, souvenirs)

We got cheap flights with China Eastern Airlines. On the way back, we had a long overnight stopover in Beijing. Since we had already visited Beijing before, we didn‚Äôt mind spending another evening there.

China Eastern offers a free hotel stay in some cities. We arrived at 4 pm, took a Didi (taxi) to the hotel, dropped off our stuff, and went out to explore the city. The next morning we could sleep in, stroll around a park, check out, and head back to the airport. The hotel keeps your checked luggage for you, so the whole process is really easy and stress-free.

  
If you have any questions, let me know!",https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1moek8k/trip_report_second_trip_in_februarymarch_2025/,"- What hotel/accommodation did you stay at in Kawaguchiko? 

I‚Äôm planning for next March/April and was thinking to stay a night there. We took a day trip the first time we went and I really loved the area and want more time to explore the second time around. 

- Do you think renting a car is necessary if we‚Äôre only planning to stay a night? 

I was thinking to stay at Kasuitei Ooya so that it‚Äôs near the station, but seeing you mention it I‚Äôd also want to go to the premium outlet!",How was the weather during that trip? I'm wondering because I am planning my trip for late Feb to early March next year. And what do you think about the strawberry festival? Is it worth going?,"This is so useful as I'm planning a two week trip next February!

Do you think you spent the right amount of time at each place?",This sounds outrageous to me considering we are going in October and our flights alone cost a combiner 3000 euros.,

I booked 14 days for November back in January and I‚Äôm paying less than $1700 total. And I‚Äôm not staying in anything terrible or any capsule hotels.,"Contrary to what some people are saying, it‚Äôs not because you are ‚Äútoo late‚Äù. I went lastt year and on 2023 and booked hotels 2 months prior, this year I am going again and rates per night are definitely more expensive in every city that I am going, Fukuoka, Kyoto and Tokyo. Sorry mate.

Oh and I am going with an 8 month old baby so wish me luck haha.",As a fellow Canadian... those prices don't seem high at all considering domestic hotel prices.,"Those prices don't feel particularly high (did you check average prices *before* booking your flights)? Either way, I am seconding those that said it's due to how late you're booking. You're now booking just over 1 month out which is quite last minute. I'm going at a similar time to you and I booked 6-8 months out with free cancellation and comparing prices we originally paid to what is currently available, prices have gone up by ¬£30+ - which doesn't necessarily sound like a lot, but it adds up. Probably doesn't help that you also have a toddler so it's harder to go with more budget friendly, smaller options.

Your itinerary is quite confusing with how it's written so I have a few questions before I can actually suggest any amendents:

* What time do you land in Japan? By the sounds of it - using context clues - (late) afternoon? It says ""easy recovery day"" but if you're landing in the afternoon and coming from a place (assuming Canada) where there's a big time jump, this is unlikely to be enough time to recover from jetlag. If you've not done this before, it might be worth expecting the next morning/day will be tougher, and if it's not, consider that a win.
* Your title says ""traveling 28th of Oct until 5th of November"" but then your itinerary says you land on the 24th of October and fly out on the 6th of November.... When are you actually travelling as it's incredibly unclear?

As a heads up, there seems to be a lot of duplication (which is one of the several reasons you shouldn't rely on ChatGPT solely for your itinerary). Example being you have Day 1 as exploring Senso-ji Temple and again on Day 4. You have Yoyogi as well both on Day 3 and Day 14 (your potential departure date). I also think you're trying to do a lot with a toddler (where you may underestimate the speed you physically can move at with a little one), but it's hard to really give specifics without properly understanding your timelines.

I would heavily suggest you review, clean it up a bit, and repost so it's clear as it's quite hard for people to give you good advice in its current form.",
1mzkfvc,"Shimanami Kaido - Onomichi to Imabari, one way","Hey!

I‚Äôve just completed Shimanami Kaido (August 2025) and thought I would share my experience in case it shortens the research process for anyone.

I was travelling alone and wanted to add the SK into my itinerary after a work trip in Hiroshima. I  didn‚Äôt want to be tied to a strict travel plan, so I arranged all of the trip within 48hrs of arriving into Onomichi, where I decided I would be starting the route. My plan was to start at Onomichi, stop for a night in Omishima, complete the route through to Imabari the next day and take the bus back up to Onomichi same day. 

I should note early on something that other posts have failed to mention - time of year. Most cyclists do the SK in spring or autumn when the temperature is moderate. August is considered a somewhat mad time of year to do the route, given summer temperatures (it was 35c when I did it.) That said, there is a good wind for most of the route and if you have an e-assist or fully electronic bike and come prepared for heat you will not suffer (too much). I made sure I had sun team, electrolytes and was glad I opted for a white helmet. Most cyclists were doing the route wearing clothes that covered their legs and arms, some were covered head to toe. I was in European sportswear, ie. Shorts, vest, trainers, sunglasses and was OK, but the locals were definitely bemused at points to see someone not covering up.

I was a little worried about hiring a bike, given what sounded like a lot of complications / considerations around one way hire etc. However I opted for the official Shimanami Kaido rental service on the basis that you could drop the bike off anywhere along the route. I did not reserve ahead, reading that there are a number of first come first served bikes available on the day.

With the rental station opening at 7am, I travelled by Shinkansen from Hiroshima Station early in the morning, arriving at Shin-Onomichi at just before 7am. I had to wait 30mins for a bus and travelled 20ish mins from here to Onomichi train station, where I checked a suitcase into a locker. NB. the lockers at the station are 600Y, though I later saw lockers at the port on the way to the ferry station for 300Y. 

The bike rental is just nearby, search ‚ÄòOnomichi Port Bicycle Rental Terminal‚Äô. By the time I arrived, just after 8am, there was still a large choice of bicycles. I opted for an e-assist bike, largely because I heard the climbs along the SK were steep and because this bike had a basket on the front (no others had a basket option). I had also heard a back pack would be difficult and I wanted to travel comfortably for the next two days. 

I‚Äôm glad of both the choice of e-assist bike and the basket, because the climbs were indeed extremely steep and long at points and the heat challenging. I would not recommend cycling with a backpack in hot weather. I saw a lot people without e-assist walking up the inclines unable to make the climb on regular bikes and looking like they hated life in this moment. Once you get off the bike and no longer have the wind, you feel it immediately and the sweat starts pouring out of you. Getting off on these inclines would easily add 30mins walking time per incline (which come each time there is a bridge to cross). If you are not a seasoned cyclist I 100% suggest the e-assist bike. If you are older or more fragile, I would suggest a fully electronic bike but bear in mind some rental places do not allow overnight rental of electronic bikes and they have to be returned within one day.

The people at the rental shop were friendly, soft spoken Japanese people. They talked you through how the electronic controls worked and gave you a map with a range of routes to follow. The most common ‚Äòsuggested‚Äô route is in blue, whilst there are also intermediate (orange) and advanced (red routes). They advised me that my route to my accommodation on Omishima would take around 4hrs, whilst the remaining route from Omishima to Imabari would take just over 3. The bike rental comes with a helmet and integrated key and lock system for your bike. The SK rental service has lots of stops along the route (maybe 10-15) , so you are able to choose where you will drop your bike off. You can also stop in if you have issues with your bike or need to change your battery. (I was advised to stop at Omishima to change my battery pack though it was only 25% down after the first day and another 25% after completing the second. I did change my battery as my accommodation was super close to the SK station, so I swung by, showed the lady in charge and she insisted I take a fresh one.)

Setting off in Onomichi you make your way to a ferry port and take a 5min journey across to Mukaishimacho port. On the other side you go, following the blue road markings on the road. I was lucky in that I got adopted by a Japanese cyclist who‚Äôd done the SK many times and who took it upon himself to guide me to my accommodation in Omishima that day. As a result I didn‚Äôt have to figure things out too much myself at this stage, but from later experience I would say it‚Äôs valuable to keep the paper route map given and to cross reference this with a phone map when needed. Your map will not show cycle routes in the area!

The route on the Onomichi side takes you largely through small towns with industrial commerce. My friend/guide took me to some lesser visited sites like the bike shrine where cyclists stop off for blessings and safety on the roads (I would not detour for this unless you‚Äôre a particularly nervous cyclist). We also stopped off at one of the Dolce gelato shops along the route - on Ikuchi Island - which was an absolute delight. I will dream of the sea salt and milk flavour herein. On the point of food - I would say don‚Äôt over plan the sustenance. There are plenty of shops along the way and looking at how my friend operated, he brought very little with him and stopped off regularly to buy cold drinks and food when he needed. So don‚Äôt come laden with supplies, there are shops frequently along the route, with a specific focus on cyclists. 

Setting off at just before 9am, we arrived at my accommodation at 1.30pm, with several stops along the way. I was pretty happy to arrive early and know that I could unwind, take a nap, or plan my onward journey without rushing, but if you‚Äôre well rested and hungry for exploration, there are many other ways to fill the day.

I booked a dorm room at the I-Link Hostel and Cafe at Omishima 36hrs before arrival and was happy with my choice. It‚Äôs worth noting that the accommodation was almost empty bar four other cyclists, so when you‚Äôre told online that there are only X number of spaces left at the accommodation, this probably means for a specific price, rather than to denote availability overall. My accommodation was extremely clean and the staff provided pyjamas, towels, toiletries, a shower and make up area, separate toilets, cafe and laundry (detergent included in fee, 300Y plus 100Y for drying). The space was peaceful, maybe too peaceful, but I was happy to rest after my early start.

I opted for dinner at the I Link and was surprised to get a delicious five course meal that I was unable to finish. There was a convenience store across the road where I also bought rehydration drinks and snacks. I would say the location of the I Link was pretty optimal given its proximity to the SK rental hub and shop, but there is very little in general in the area or along this part of the route to interact with. You‚Äôre very much amongst nature and the not-unattractive barrenness of the area.

I hit the sack at about 9.30pm with the aim to wake up at 7am and get going by 8am to beat the heat. I managed to get going by around 9am and being guideless this time, I enjoyed part of the morning going off piste, turning off into small villages and seeing what rural life looks like on these islands. I also cycled off the main route by the water, where the road often merged with the SK route after short distances. I‚Äôd say this part of the SK becomes much interesting - there is more greenery, waterside beauty and less of the isolated industrial feel that the Onomichi - Omishima part had. There were some sections where it felt possible to find secluded beaches by foot, eg. At the base of the Hakata-Oshima bridge coming from Omishima, but I didn‚Äôt do this as I was a female travelling alone. The climbs towards Imabari are longer and steeper, but if you have a e-assist it is all pretty easy and the surrounding nature makes the experience pretty elating. I really enjoyed this part of the route. 

Imabari is quite suburban (though empty feeling, as the rest of the route) and the nature peters out as you reach the city centre. I reached the SK bicycle rental at 12.45pm, handed my bike back, bought some lunch and managed to catch a bus heading towards Onomichi at just past 1pm. You take the bus to Fukuoka, change at a small service station at Innoshima-Ohashi and continue onto Onomichi from there. There is no direct bus and the wait at Innoshima-Ohashi was 45mins. I paid 1100Y for the first leg and around 600Y for the second.

I would say that 2 days to do the Onomichi-Imabari route one way is perfect. You could do it all in one day, but my sense is that this would feel pressured and quite stressful. Unless you‚Äôre mad on cycling I would also suggest that doing the route one way is enough. The thought of retracing my steps - or bringing my bike back - would not appeal to me.

Overall I really enjoyed the experience, feeling I would never see a part of Japan like this without visiting it by bike. The whole organisation on the Japanese side was pretty faultless and I felt very little anxiety throughout. That said, it felt a shame that there was so little around the route itself, which felt a little post-apocalyptic and desolate at times. There were moments where I felt I understood why islands like this suffer  depopulation issues and considered whether the experience feel more celebratory were local businesses to offer a glimpse into their operation or some initiatives be devised to encourage cyclists to linger. That said, the touristification of places comes with many downsides so maybe it‚Äôs good to enjoy the SK for what it is.

One edit - Tuesday is a day off on the SK, ie. Not all rentals will be open and shops might be closed. I cycled Sunday - Monday to avoid this so am not able to share what I know, but I‚Äôd plan with caution as a result!

In conclusion, items needed:
* A bag that you don‚Äôt have to carry on your back
* Sun cream if travelling in sunny conditions 
* A small towel to wipe your face. I had this on my shoulder whilst cycling and it was invaluable
* A battery pack to make sure you can navigate throughout your adventure (but your accommodation will likely have a range of ports for you to charge from too)
* A change of clothing, though possible to lounge in provided pyjamas 

Not necessary:
* Water bottle/thermos (not many water stations to refill at unfortunately)
* Food - lots of shops along the way, with sushi, breads and ready meals + a microwave for reheating. The food may not be your ideal way of eating, but you won‚Äôt go hungry
* Hat - you‚Äôll be wearing a helmet anyway
* Cash - the ferry does not take card payments, alongside the bus, laundry etc
* Bike lock, unless taking own bike 
* Basic toiletries 
* Swimming costume - I didn‚Äôt see anybody swimming in the sea, even at the height of summer and my guide told me swimming isn‚Äôt really a thing along the SK. I would say that what I saw would correlate, although I did see some literature encouraging cyclists to keep cool during summer by stopping off at swimming spots

A final tip. Japanese people are pretty reserved until you speak to them or ask them for help. Once you breach the gap you‚Äôll find they are ready to help and befriend you, despite any language barrier.

I'm planning on doing the SK on Sept 9-10, staying in a hotel in Onomichi the night before, and heading off early.  I'm staying at WAKKA, which is just down the road from iLink Hostel.  There seem to be a couple of off-trail spots on the way to Omishima that could delay our arrival a bit, but generally I expect we'll arrive at a similar time you did.

Also, what kind of seats do the electronic-assist bikes have?  Wide or narrow?  I want to purchase a padded seat cover, but unsure of size.",Thanks for the write up!

I was planning to do the Shimanami Kaido on my upcoming trip in November but decided to postpone it for next time. 

I was also going to be on my own so I was thinking of just doing about half the route so I didn't have to find my way back from Imabari. Something like the first 2-3 islands on the main route and then loop back around on one of the other routes to end up back at Onomichi before the bike return deadline. I haven't ridden a bike since I was a kid though and I've never tried an e-bike so that might be something I practice first before I try the Shimanami Kaido lol.",

Nikko is much farther away so it's a full day trip and more expensive. You also have almost nothing planned for it an dyou need to since there's two different zones you can go to and you need to know which sights/activities you'll be visiting in whichever you'll visit.


Go to Nagoya early in the morning and do Inuyama castle, not Nagoya, which is only a reconstrucion. You'll have time for Osu in the afternoon/evening.


Instead of Osaka castle, which is another reconstruction, do Himeji castle on your Kobe day. And you can eat Kobe beef (or many other wagyu brands) anywhere in Japan.","The main thing I'll say is dont burn yourself out, especially in Tokyo. On those days where you're planning to visit multiple districts, just be wary that even though public transport is great in Tokyo you're still going to be walking tons!

Hey guys, probably the most asked question around, but can any experienced traveler tell me if I'm being over ambitious in my itinerary?

Meiji Jingu -> Harajuku -> Shinjuku Gyoen -> Shibuya is probably the most sensible path.

Oct 11:

If you manage to get the tickets, choose either Ginza or Akihabara

Oct 15:

I would probably rather go for Tofuku-ji and Fushimi Inari (before dusk), when the crowds at the latter are much smaller. Or use the day for Nishiki Market (though these days it is perfectly skippable).

Oct 17:

I would probably do Uji (Byodo-in + tea house) in the morning and Nara from noon onwards.

Oct 20:

Worth noting that Yanaka Ginza opens fairly late (11am), so I would stick to Daikaynyama/Ebisu and Shimokitazawa (or vice versa depending on your priorities), or go to Yanaka Ginza on 21st.","I recommend staying in east Tokyo on arrival and west Tokyo before departure. If you're not a fan of nightlife, avoid Shinjuku & Shibuya on the weekends. It will be the most crowded, loud, and expensive accommodations wise.","Yanaka, Shimokitazawa, and Daikanyama are all far apart, and train connections are complicated. Since you'll need to walk around all of them, it might be best to narrow it down to two.","Nothing looks wrong with this itinerary to me overall but if you want to make the commute a bit less stressful, you could consider luggage forwarding. This is extremely common in Japan, and not very expensive.

Depending on where you‚Äôre staying in Hakone (eg. You need to climb a steep hill or take a bus) and how much luggage you have, it could be worth forwarding your suitcase from Tokyo to Kyoto and just having a backpack for your night there. It may not be strictly necessary but it can really make those commutes easier so it‚Äôs worth considering! Making a wrong turn in a station with a suitcase and having to carry it back up stairs is no fun lol",

In a couple of months my then-husband and I are going on our honeymoon to Tokyo.

We're rounding up our itinerary now, so I came to ask if anyone has any idea or warning about something to change.

Couple of notes:

* Yes, we're nerds, what gave it away?
* We tried to group neighbourhoods together if we hit two on the same day. Trusting on Google for travel times/distance, but it could be very wrong.
* No AI was involved at any point in the process.

* Ueno Park/Ueno exploration

November 2nd - Nakano/Shinjuku

* Nakano Broadway/Sun Mall

Your Shinjuku day is a bit light - I always like to recommend the Gyoen - it's quite nice to walk through, though being completely honest, I don't know how it will be in November (I went many many years in a row for Tokyo Game Show in September).

Consider carving off Skytree into its own day with Sensoji/Asakusa since you were looking for a spot for it.  It's not really close geographically to Shibuya, so it sticks out there a little bit.

For Disney, if you have been to a Magic Kingdom park anywhere in the world, I do highly recommend doing DisneySea instead. It has a very unique feel.  Also remember it's like an hour from the city proper to Maihama station (and then about another 10 minutes of transit from there just to get to the gate).  Give yourself enough time.","Everything stays open on Culture Day. Expect things to be busy though.

This itinerary looks good and is a welcome change from the cookie cutter itineraries that are usually posted here.","Looks solid for a first Tokyo trip. A couple easy tweaks:

Pair Asakusa with Skytree on the same day. They sit next to each other, so do Sensoji in the morning, then walk or hop a quick train to Skytree. Keep Shibuya on its own day so you are not zigzagging.

Culture Day on Nov 3 is not a forced rest. It is a public holiday, so expect crowds and some traditional events around the city. Wrestling in Ryogoku is a fun pick. Show up a bit early and eat in the area.

teamLab Planets is in Toyosu, not Odaiba proper. Still close. Get a timed entry for first slot or later evening to dodge lines. If you want ‚ÄúOdaiba‚Äù vibes, ride the Yurikamome over the Rainbow Bridge for the views and then hit DiverCity or the seaside park.

For your open days, slot in Ueno Park with Yanaka for a slower old-Tokyo feel, or do Tokyo Dome City and then Koishikawa Korakuen next door for a classic garden break. If you want a quick book crawl, Jimbocho is great.

Kamakura/Enoshima works as a day trip if you wake up with the energy. Hasedera -> Kotoku-in -> Enoden to the coast is the simple route. On very clear days you can even spot Fuji from the Shonan shoreline. Use [isfujivisible.com](http://isfujivisible.com) to scan the week and grab the day that looks clear. It saves you from guessing.

Pok√©mon Caf√© is tough to book. If you miss it, the Ikebukuro Pok√©mon Center in Sunshine City still scratches the itch. Disneyland on Nov 5 as a full day is perfect. Get there for gates open and you will be fine.","I salute you fellow spreadsheet planner!

I had a pretty similar itinerary for my first trip to Japan 1.5 years ago. I loved it so much that me and my wife decided to move here full time :)  
  
\- Pro tip #1: bring as little stuff with you as possible, you will buy a lot and will appreciate that extra luggage space :)

\- Pro tip #2: beware of Tokyo Akihabara & Osaka Denden Town prices, especially when it comes to nerdy stuffs. If you already have some items in mind that you'd like to buy, it's best to buy it on japanese online auction/flea markets ahead of your trip and get it conveniently delivered to your hotel when you're in Japan. I happen to run a service like this out of Fukuoka, check my bio for the link in case you're interested \^\^.

Wishing you all the best on your trip to Japan!",

It's very similar in pace than the two times I've been. But to each their own I guess 

It gives you a lot more time to enjoy and discover each location than trying to rush it, take photos than immediately head to the next one especially if you're bringing your father.

I think it looks great and really enjoyable!","Not at all. The first time I went to Japan, we were only in Tokyo for a week and we felt like it was TOO little! 

IMO, just depends on the type of traveler you are. 

If you wanna have a chill relaxing holiday, you're fine. If you wanna rush to see sights here and there, then go ahead and add some more stuff.

Personally, I prefer an itinerary where it's 1-2 activity packed days, then 1-2 lax days, and so on. Keeps it not too rushed and enjoyable.","2 weeks in tokyo is still not enough

i recommend doing ueno at night and akiba during the day though",

Also any good watch shops in Osaka specifically? I plan on coming home with a Made in Japan time piece. Thanks!","Dear all,

My wife and I have been to Japan several times and are planning our next trip during which we will be staying in the Greater Tokyo Area most of the time.

Our understanding is that a day trip we would not leave us enough time to reach Jigokudani Monkey Park by public transport so we are instead considering taking the Shinkansen and then booking a tour guide that would pick us up at the station in Nagano and show us around (before dropping us back at the station at the end of the day). Has anyone booked a similar day trip?

I should add that we do not know yet exactly when we will be traveling. Are there particular months during which Jigokudani Monkey Park should be avoided?

Or would you instead recommend staying in Matsumoto or Nagano City?

Thank you!","If my trip is in 9 weeks, and I don't have any of it planned, should I plan now or reschedule?

My partner last their passport and has been dealing with that. Because of it, I didn't want to waste time or money for something that might not happen. They just expedited the passport and it should be here within 3 weeks.

What would you do? We got a great price, so if we rescheduled, it would be double the price.","I have a foliage trip planned for Nov into Dec, but I‚Äôm likely moving it due to an injury. I‚Äôm devastated. I‚Äôm considering it to 2/15/26 - 3/11/26 covering Hiroshima, Kyoto, Kanazawa, & Tokyo. I just learned that Chinese Lunar New Year overlaps with my dates, and I cannot push it forward due to missing markets I have planned and the cherry blossom season price increases in March & April. Is it that bad of an idea to go during Lunar New Year? If I have to push to November 26 I likely won‚Äôt be able to go.","We are going to be in Fukuoka and Beppu approximately Sept 12th-18th and we'd really love to go on a nice hike, but it's quite difficult to tell what mountains are capable of being done by two people who have done the hike to the top of Fushimi Inari but that's about the max we can hike-wise. Also, what's actually worth doing to see some beautiful nature and possibly interesting things along the way up. From what I've looked at, there's a lot of great sort of exposed hikes that look like they might be rough in Sept heat- are there any more foresty areas?

If anyone has any suggestions or advice, I'd be grateful!"
1n79ykf,Kawaguchiko Day Trip Feedback,"Hello,

This community have been of a tremendous help for me to plan out the 2 weeks visit to Japan starting late September and ending early October.  
The one grey area I have left is a day trip to Kawaguchiko.  
I do understand that it may be very packed for a single day visit, could you please provide tips whether it looks doable or not?

Below are the details that I have laid out and added bit of transportation research too. Please don't pay too much attention to hours, those are rough. I'm looking for the feedback for the overall day.

Thanks in advance.

7:00 **Train to Kawaguchiko** via Fuji Excursion Limited Express 

9:00 **Chureito Pagoda** \---- Train: Kawaguchiko ‚Üí Shimoyoshida Station (Fujikyu Line) 

11:00 **Hotou Fudo Kawaguchiko Station Food** \----- Train: Train back to Kawaguchiko Station

13:00 **Mt. Fuji Panoramic Ropeway** \----- Transport: 10‚Äì15 min walk 

**Saiko Iyashi-no-Sato Nenba (Traditional Japanese Village)** \----- Transport: Green Line Bus from Ropeway area or Kawaguchiko Station

**Sanrokuen Food** \--- Transport: Short walk from Kawaguchiko station

18:30 -19:00 **Ride back to Tokyo** \---- Transport:  Fuji Excursion Limited Express or Bus",https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1n79ykf/kawaguchiko_day_trip_feedback/,"DIY-ed our Kawaguchiko day trip December last year. The first half of your itinerary we did the same. In the afternoon we only stayed in the Kawaguchiko area. Here's what I can share:
- Fujikyu __express__ trains run only a few times a day. The earliest one from Shinjuku station leaves 7:30 AM and the next at 8:30. The last one leaving from Kawaguchiko station is at 5:33 PM.
- Reserve __express__ train tickets so you have guaranteed seats. If the train is full you will have to stand for the majority of the trip
- Kawaguchiko will have lots of visitors. Expect lots of people going to the same places particularly middle of the day and so it may become unpleasant for you if you are not used to a lot of people.
- The Sightseeing buses will be full, particularly the Red one that goes from Kawaguchiko station to the Ropeway to Oishi Park and back to Kawaguchiko station via the same route. It may be difficult to get on a bus from the middle stops. Take note of this if you are trying to manage time.","If you have enough time and if you, like me, find out that the line for the Ropeway is over an hour long when you get there, know that there is actually a MUCH more scenic short hike up the south side of the mountain, with a viewing square that offers a beautiful, scenic, far less crowded view of Mt. Fuji. This ended up being one of the best things that happened to me on my entire Japan trip. Ended up hiking it with a fellow tourist in line who overheard my conversation with the Ropeway operator, we became friends, and two days later he invited me to spend the day getting out of Tokyo and checking out shrines and temples southward on the way to the Enoshima Sea Candle. Amazing day trip if you also have the time in Tokyo and the inclination to get out of the city, happy to share more details.

Finally (though you probably won't have this issue) the maple leaves at the top of the Ropeway had already browned/dropped when I went in November, and only the trees on the hillside along the hiking trail were still red, and we got incredible photos framing Fuji in red maple leaves! Highly recommend you hike it if you want! Here's a Maps link: https://maps.app.goo.gl/gq4gxkYsGjEnUQCT6

The long straightaway isn't actually straight but the trail is very visible and there were several other hikers taking it.

edit: Also, ate at this place across the street from the station. Cheap, delicious local noodles: https://maps.app.goo.gl/nUoc5rvtX3VLuN7h9","I‚Äôd say your itinerary is fine for a day trip, but you‚Äôre definitely missing out on some of the best bits by virtue of having less time. 

I would really recommend staying overnight. Kawaguchiko has so much cool stuff around it and it might have been my favourite non-city that I stayed in. 

By 9am Chureito Pagoda will be extremely busy and you‚Äôll really struggle to get a decent picture. It‚Äôs pretty weather dependent on getting the Fuji shot, so check that before you leave. You basically need to get there at like 6am to snap a decent pic and even then there are still people. It depends on how badly you want to see it, but I would say maybe skip if you only have a day?

If you stay over, you‚Äôll probably get a better shot.

The Ropeway is great, but you will queue up for likely 30-60 mins to get in. Views at the top are amazing and they do really yummy Mount Fuji dango. 

Tenku no Torii also has an amazing view of Fuji, but it‚Äôs a bit of a hike. If you‚Äôre prepared to walk, this is 100% worth checking. 

I would also check out Aokigahara forest and hiking for a few hours through Fugaku and Marisa ice/wind caves. It‚Äôs just a very quiet, very still forest with some eerie and mysterious history that I really enjoyed. You can take the bus to and from Kawaguchiko to get there iirc.

In the evening, sit by Kawaguchiko lake and watch the sun set over the water and Mount Fuji. It‚Äôs incredibly beautiful. I usually stocked up on 7 Elven/Lawson food and had dinner with a view. 

There‚Äôs lots of pretty cheap onsens to stay in here as well. I can personally recommend one that was ran by the cutest elderly couple.",Omfg this was my favorite thing I saw in Japan ‚Ä¶ enjoy!!!,"Skip the ropeway, do the boat ride that goes across the lake, but only if Fuji is visible."
1n5yto6,Help Refining Itinerary 14 Full Days Oct 30th to November 14th,"Hello I have worked together an itinerary for my first trip to Japan. I want to ensure I am not slamming to much into the trip. I have interests in history and cultural sites mostly with some interest in the anime/manga stops for a bit. I utilized the Lonely Planet Japan guide book to get most of my ideas together and some online searching.

I land in Tokyo and Depart from Tokyo, these days are set (Arrive October 30th and Depart November 14th), I am going solo so the trip does not take another person into account. I have some questions about my schedule below but any other advice or thoughts would be helpful before I begin to book rooms.

1. I don't know if I have too little decided for Day 1? I feel like I may be tired from the flight so it might be best to take it slow. Was planning to stay the night in the area so I could get started early.
2. Day 2 also feels light but Osaka seems like a more ""go with the flow"" style so I kept it more open since searching for specifics didn't really give me anything I was driven for.
3. Wasn't sure if i should try to go to Himije Castle on my way to Hiroshima, or on the way to Kyoto or at all? (See Day 4 & 5)
4. Day 6 and Day 7 I wasn't sure if I was packing too much into them based on distances?
5. I wasn't sure on the Hakone trip, I thought it would be nice for a rest, do what I can and not too much? (See Day 10 & 11)
6. Are my last days in Tokyo doable or is it too crammed? I figured I would leave some blank space so if I decide I want to do something else or just rest.

Day 13 in particular is too busy - the Tokyo National Museum is huge and needs at least half a day.

I‚Äôd suggest skipping the Umeda Sky building as Osaka doesn‚Äôt have a particularly interesting skyline: all you see is urban sprawl, which won‚Äôt mean much to you if you‚Äôve just arrived in the city.

I don‚Äôt see the point of staying on Miyajima as it‚Äôs an easy trip from Hiroshima, which is a great city.",[deleted],"Day 1 does seem a touch light, but nothing awful.  Walk around Harajuku and Omotesando, enjoy the time.

Himeji is probably a little better as an Osaka to Hiroshima timing wise.  Check the hours on the castle entry and consider where it fits into your goals.  Or maybe if Osaka isn't ""speaking"" to you, slide over there on Day 3?  Pick up DenDen on Day 2 afternoon/evening when there is a bit more life, then that juggles 2/3 a bit.

Good call on hitting Fushimi Inari and Arashiyama early.  Alternatively, find different, less visited locations.

Kyoto has a manga museum you might consider.  You've still got a chance at Ghibli Museum (Tokyo) or Park (Nagoya) tickets.","Oof, I don't know about you, but days 6-9 look a little too temple-heavy to me. Don't get me wrong tho. I love visiting temples but by then I think i'd be prob having some serious temple fatigue. Also, not sure if you considered autumn during your trip? Peak usually hits Kyoto/Nara in mid-Nov, so you might be just a tad bit early for the best views. In any case, might I suggest removing some things on your final days in Tokyo, esp day 13?

1muvd9u,3 Week Honeymoon Itinerary - Critique Please,"Hi - after reading what feels like thousand of reddit posts, blogs etc I think I've settled on our itinerary for our honeymoon in November. 

**Questions I'd like answered please:**

\- Please could I have a sense check as to whether we are being overly ambitious with our travelling in particular? Happy to use luggage services to send these onward for the major cities where feasible. 

\- Should we use our ryokan stays elsewhere - I do wonder if there is better value having a night in Kinosaki or Kyoto rather than two nights in Hakone?

\- Is this too much in terms of combining relaxation (is that feasible on your first time in Japan?) and adventure? 

\- Are we missing anything - there is probably some activities to flash out in Tokyo / Kyoto so very much open to suggestions? Should we consider adding an onsen town like Gero / Kinosaki?

\- I don't mind hiring a car, would we benefit from doing a road trip say from Kanazawa to Tokyo?

Thanks",https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1muvd9u/3_week_honeymoon_itinerary_critique_please/,"I think this is probably one of the most sensible itinerary I've seen on here. 

Sure there are some really touristy places that aren't exactly romantic but at least you break up the trip with some nice ryokan and slower paced days. I applaud you for doing two nights at hakone because most people don't know how rush it is to just stay one night at an onsen ryokan. 

The rest of the trip is fine, the only day I think is not quite doable is a day trip to Osaka and a distillery tour, I may not put them together, but maybe you have more energy than I do.","For 25-26 Nov (Kanazawa), be aware that after 5pm its very dark, so most things would be closed. This is the same for Takayama as well. Many shops in Higashi Chaya would be closed. It would be better to have more time in Kanazawa.

For 26 Nov Evening, im assuming you would wanna go for omakase sushi, be sure to make a prior reservation on Tabelog. Most places don't take walk-ins",I like the flow. I especially like how you fit fukuoka and then do a gradual trip back,"To contrast with other commenters, I think staying 2 nights or less at each place isn't a good idea. You""ll lose a dreadful amount of time traveling between towns, check-in at the hotel and then go to the attraction. Also all the hurdle with luggages, since luggage forwarding take at least 2 days you would have to time it right and really hope there won't be any delayal.

And you would be prisoner of your plan, with no possibility to any variations depending on your mood, tiredness, or footsores .

As much as I understand the need to see and experience so many different locations, it would be far less stressful to focus on a max 5-6 hotel for a 3 weeks trip, and you would be less tired and able to enjoy much more each single day.",

Sounds fun all around though, I hope you enjoy your trip!",
1mz6s8r,"First ever solo trip to Tokyo, Osaka, Kyoto for 16 days in September.","Hi all,

I'm doing my first ever solo trip starting 2nd September and I picked Japan as my destination due to the numerous good things I've heard regarding safety, activites, culture and friend recommendations. I've made a very rough plan of things I wouldn't mind seeing during my time in Japan but other than activites I've had to reserve tickets for, nothing is set in stone and if anything catches my eye wandering around I'm more than happy to divert to explore. My plan doesn't feature any food stops or bars as it'll be a case of deciding as and when I'll want a break or if I fancy a night drinking. So far here is my 'finished' itinernary.

**2nd September - Flight from UK/Doha/Haneda**

* Arrive at Haneda 23:55, will pick up a physical Suica if possible at this time, if not use iPhone wallet, taxi to hotel in Shinjuku and hopefully sleep!

**3rd September - Shinjuku**

* Shinjuku Gyoen
* Hanazono Shrine
* Kabukicho Tower
* Tokyo Metropolitan Goverment bulidling, both for the view and to see one of the evening light shows
* Golden Gai? Depending on how jet lagged I am at this point.

**4th September - Shibuya**

* Yoyogi Park
* Center Gai
* Nintendo/Capcom/Pokemon/SEGA Stores
* Don Quijote
* Shibuya Sky at 20:20

**5th September - Day trip to Kamakura/Enoshima**

Kamakura

* Kotoku-in
* Hase Temple (Hasedera)
* Tsurugaoka Hachimangu Shrine
* Komachi Street

Enoshima

* Enoshima Aquarium
* Enoshima Benten Shrine
* Iwaya Caves
* Enoshima Sea Candle and Garden
* Benzaiten Nakamise Street

There's also the possiblity of me just wanting to hit the beach and go in the sea for a little while so this plan will very likely change.

**6th September - Osaka**

* Shinkansen to Osaka, purchase ticket at station rather than pre book, leave luggage at hotel as I'll arrive before check in time.
* Osaka Castle Park
* Namba Yasaka Shrine
* Nipponbashi
* Dotonbori

Will be returning to hotel at some point after 3pm to check in.

**7th September - Day Trip to Nara**

* Kofuku-ji Temple
* Nara Park
* Kasuga Taisha Shrine
* Todai-ji Temple

**8th September - Osaka**

* Kaiyukan Aquarium
* Umeda Sky Building
* Pokemon Centre
* Tsuruhashi
* Shinsekai
* Dotonbori
* Visit Space Station Bar? Sounds a fun bar

**9th September - Osaka, Universal Studios**

* Enjoy my childhood self in Super Nintendo World
* Try doing everything else!

**10th September - Kyoto**

* Train from Osaka to Kyoto, leave luggage at hotel as I'll arrive early
* Explore Gion
* Higashiyama

Not planning much for this day as my feet will most likely be destroyed from USJ, will return to hotel after 3pm to check in.

**11th September - Kyoto/Uji**

* Early start Fushimi-Inari hike 
* Nintendo Museum at 15:00

Again, light day, will be relying on things catching my eye this day.

**12th September - Kyoto**

* Early start at Kiyomizudera
* Kinkakuji (Golden Pavilion)
* Ryoan-ji
* Sagano Bamboo Forest
* Arashiyama Monkey Park Iwatayama (Maybe)

**13th September - Tokyo, Akihabara**

* Shinkansen to Tokyo, leave luggage at hotel in Akihabara as I'll be arriving early
* Yodobashi Akiba
* Namco Akihabara
* Tokyo Skytree at 19:30

I've booked the skytree for this day as I don't think I'll have much time on the later days to try it and I would like to see it in the evening. I'll most likely be wandering in the various arcades and anime shops this day.

**14th September - Ueno/Akihabara**

* Ueno Park
* Ameyoko Shopping Street
* Monster Hunter Cafe at 16:00
* teamLab Borderless at 19:30

**15th September - Asakusa**

* Sensoji Temple
* Culture Tourist Info Centre
* FC Tokyo vs Tokyo Verdy football match at 19:00 at Ajinomoto Stadium, I know this isn‚Äôt in Asakusa be will be going to the stadium from there.

Again, another day where I'll wander around Asakusa for anything to catch my eye.

**16th September - DisneySea**

* **Enjoy the day!**

**17th September - Best of Tokyo**

* Tokyo Sea Life Park

I've left this day pretty much empty as I'll be using it to revisit my favourite places as it's my last full day in Japan.

**18th September - Fly back to the UK**

* My flight isn't until 22:50 so again I'll be using the day to wander around locally and get ready to go home, will probably head to Haneda airport around 19:00.

And that's it for my plan, any advice, warnings, criticism and recommendations are welcomed!

  
EDIT: One thing I will ask for in regards for food, is Kobe beef better in Tokyo, Osaka or Kyoto?",https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1mz6s8r/first_ever_solo_trip_to_tokyo_osaka_kyoto_for_16/,"You allocated one neighborhood per day in Tokyo but in Osaka and Kyoto you're trying to do like 3 or 4 on the same day. 

5th- You most likely won't be able to do all of that because of travel and closing times, and that's without going to the beach.

6th- That's too much if you're traveling between cities and checking in.

8th- Probably also too much.  

11th- The Nintendo Museum is in Uji, not Kyoto (Kyoto prefecture, but different city). You might want to seize the opportunity and visit something else while you are there, like Byodo-in for example.

12th- Look at a map. You're literally trying to go all over the city on the same day.",">Arrive at Haneda 23:55

Does the hotel you picked allow you to check in at this hour? Make sure to check...

>Kabukicho

>Golden Gai? Depending on how jet lagged I am at this point.

As long as you know what you're getting into... I mean, Kabukicho isn't great, especially in the evening. Golden Gai is just a dump. Not sure how much fun you'd have going bar-hopping alone. Or are you fluent in the language?

>**4th September - Shibuya**

>Yoyogi Park

Might want to swap this for something else - Yoyogi Park is under construction. Or at least the central pond is - not really much to see. Unless they'll be done by this date, but idk, didn't bother checking the info board when I was there. Maybe just check out the Meji shrine instead?

>Tokyo Skytree at 19:30

Mmm... While the cityscape at night is quite pretty, wouldn't you get more out of the fantastic sights by going during the day? :)

>is Kobe beef better in Tokyo, Osaka or Kyoto?

This entirely depends on the restaurant. But since you're in Osaka for a few days, why not take a daytrip to Kobe instead? Get it straight from the source, so to speak :)

Anyway.

This all seems like a *lot*. I suppose it's fine if you use this list as a ""things-i-*could*\-do"" instead of a ""things-i-**must**\-do"" guide. But you'll be walking a lot of steps. Literally, in the case of Fushimi Inari, if you decide to get to the very topmost shrine.","That‚Äôs an awesome first solo trip, you‚Äôve got a good mix of the big spots and some chill days to wander. A couple tips: Osaka is great for food so save your Kobe beef splurge for there, it‚Äôll feel more authentic than Tokyo. Kamakura + Enoshima is a long day but doable, just be ready for lots of walking. For Fuji views, September can be tricky with haze so check [isfujivisible.com](https://isfujivisible.com) before you go. You might catch a clear day from Tokyo or on the Shinkansen. Overall, super solid plan, just pace yourself so you don‚Äôt burn out.","Most days, especially in the first half of the trip, are too busy.¬†

Note that Kabukicho is a red light district, in case that‚Äôs not what you‚Äôre looking for.¬†",
1n4nqe9,"16 Day Otaku Solo Trip in November. | Is it too much? | Osaka, Tokyo","Hey guys, been lurking in this subreddit for a while to draft out my November plans. Please tell me if it's too packed. I like overplanning to ensure I have backup plans when I run into free time or if I decide to skip places.

I've been to Japan a couple times to visit family and friends. This time I focused on nature walks and my otaku driven hobbies. I tried to put them in the order I'll go through them every day, but I can easily swap days as needed if weather affects my plans. 

I'll be awake around 5-6 am and head to bed by 10 pm latest most days. (This is my literal sleeping schedule right now since I work nights) My main issue is finding morning activities to fill in the lull before places are open. Most morning breakfasts in Osaka will probably be Matsuya for budget or Komeda as an alternative. In Tokyo, I have Dormy Inn for breakfast and soba if I want a light dinner at night. I plan to buy quick meals in the market for days I wake up before restaurants are open (hike/day trips). 

Lunches and early dinners are when I'll splurge for good meals. I just pinned a bunch of spots featured in JapanEats I liked and recommendations from friends for whenever I get hungry.

All places with asterisk (\*) are optional pivots if I'm ahead of schedule and finish early. If you have any suggestions enroute for days lemme know.



 \---

Day 1 ‚Äì Nov 4  

\- Arrive in Osaka (KIX)

\- Check in at Namba Hotel  

\- Dinner at Sushiro or Yakiniku



Depending on energy levels, I might knock out early. I'll land in the afternoon, but I doubt I'll get any sleep on flight. Sushiro or Yakiniku should be good for a low stress meal. I'll make a supply run to a supermarket nearby like LIFE to get some drinks and discounted bentos/onigiris for quick meals. Depends on selection.



\---

Day 2 ‚Äì Nov 5  

\- Shop in Umeda

\- Hanshin Tigers Shop  

\- Kinokuniya Umeda  

\- MARUZEN & JUNKUDO  

\- Mandarake Umeda    

\- FireBomBAR



After Hanshin Tigers, I don't mind going off script if I something that catches my interest. I just wanted some places I know I'll be interested to head towards as a framework.



\---

Day 3 ‚Äì Nov 6  

\- Kobe Day Trip  

\- Nunobiki Falls Hike

\- Nunobiki Herb Garden\* (Might be too early so I'll pass if so)

\- Kobe Beef Ramen Yazawa

\- Center Plaza West

\- Motomachi Street\*

\- Chinatown / Guanyu Temple  

\- Kobe Minato Onsen Lotus



I should be able to get on the trail by 7AM. Might wake up earlier than 5 AM today. I'll take the ropeway down if I need the break, but I don't mind the exercise. I fully expect to be here all day and end in the onsen around 9 PM



\---

Day 4 ‚Äì Nov 7  

\- Kizu Market  

\- Sennichimae Doguyasuji/Kuromon Market\* (If DenDenTown not open yet)

\- Den Den Town    

\- Amerikamura  

\- CAOFF DISCOVERY  

\- Dotonbori\*



I haven't been to Kizu Market so I decided to check it out. If anyone has any suggestions for stuff to do before Noon in the area, let me know. Considered going to Tsuruhashi instead of Amerikamura.



\---

Day 5 ‚Äì Nov 8  

\- Minoh Falls

\- Ryuan-ji Temple  

\- Katsuoji Temple\*  

\- Tempura no Yama  

\- Relaxation Salon Fortuna (Or another Spa option)

\- Head to Bed Early  



I had considered walking through the Takedao Abandoned Railway Trail, but I chose Minoh Falls instead since it's autumn. I plan to retire by early afternoon and try to get a spa visit appointment to decompress so I can sleep blissfully.

Tomorrow will be a long day so I plan to sleep around 9 PM or so.



\---

Day 6 ‚Äì Nov 9  

\- Shinkansen to Nagoya (Early Morning)

\- Nagoya Castle (Gift Shop Only)

\- Osu Shotengai  

\- Nagoya Touken Museum\*

\- Hard Off / Hobby Off Shimadaminami\*

\- Shinkansen to Tokyo (Evening)

\- Check in at Dormy Inn  



I regret setting my hotels early on in Osaka and Tokyo. Spending a night here would of been less hectic. According to the dates, some of the places I had considered won't be open on this day. I plan to arrive in Nagoya early in the morning on the first train or so and be in Dormy Inn around 8-9 PM.



\---

Day 7 ‚Äì Nov 10  

\- Akihabara  

\- Nakano Broadway  

\- Find Dinner in Nakano Area  



Didn't plan to fill this up too much. I've been here many times already, so I'll probably finish early and look for stuff to do after browsing Nakano Broadway. Might revisit a maid cafe. Any suggestions for places to go around Nakano Area to eat?



\---

Day 8 ‚Äì Nov 11  

Mt. Takao & Hachioji  

\- Mt. Takao hike (Trail 6 up / Trail 1 down)  

\- Keio Takaosan Onsen Gokurakuyu  

\- Lunch here or wait until DAPS\*  

\- ECO Town (Hard Off Megastore)  

\- DAPS Famous Hood Joint  

\- Inokashira Park  



Wonder if I'll get any good autumn leaves on this day. ECO Town and DAPS is the main reason I wanted to come to this area. If it rains I'll do something else in Kichijoji or swap to another day's plans.



\---

Day 9 ‚Äì Nov 12  

\- Head to Saitama  

\- Visit Friends  

\- Omiya Bonsai Village

\- Railway Museum\*



I like bonsai. Might go trainspotting.



\---

Day 10 ‚Äì Nov 13  

\- Yokohama Day Trip

\- Shonan Monorail (Flexible)

\- Amimoto Izu Sushi  

\- Yokohama Chinatown (Guanyu Temple here too?)

\- Yamashita Park\*

\- Red Brick Warehouse\*  



Saw a good spot to film the Monorail passing you from below on youtube and wanted to check it out. Post Chinatown is mostly filler.



\---

Day 11 ‚Äì Nov 14  

\- Okachimachi Niconico Theater (Guaranteed event on Fridays)



There's an idol event here every Friday so unless I find another one available, I'll probably go here.



\---

Day 12 ‚Äì Nov 15  

\- Design Festa Vol 62  

\- Odaiba Statue of Liberty  

\- Unicorn Gundam Statue  

\- Dinner in Odaiba\* (Or just head back if too crowded)



Not sure how crowded Design Festa will get this year, but it'll be nice to find something cool here. Good excuse to check out Odaiba more if I decide to leave early.



\---

Day 13 ‚Äì Nov 16  

\- Hatonosu Gorge  

\- Moegi-no-Yu Onsen  

\- Gallery Poppo\*  

\- Lunch at Gorge or DAPS food joint

\- Tori no Ichi Festival (Shinjuku)



Hatonosu Gorge was originally an alternative plan I thought of if I didn't want to head to Mt Takao. This was originally a free day, so I can easily change this to something else if I get updates on more events.



\---

Day 14 ‚Äì Nov 17  

\- Miyashita Park

\- Shibuya PARCO

\- Shibuya MODI  

\- glamb (Harajuku)

\- Tokyu Food Show (Souvenirs)

\- Bar Ginza Panorama Shibuya (Revisit)



Souvenir Day. Getting omiyage for friends and family. If you're into trains and train models, Panorama Bar is worth checking out. The owner and regulars there are pretty welcoming.



\---

Day 15 ‚Äì Nov 18  

\- Check in Hamamatsucho Hotel (Leave bags early morning check in later)

\- Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building  

\- ARTNIA (Square Enix Cafe)\*  

\- Shinjuku Marui Annex  

\- Tower Records Shinjuku  

\- Kabukicho  



Fudged my hotel/flight dates. Decided on a hotel closer to the Tokyo Monorail to make the best of it. Since it's the last day, I'll probably stay out late. I always wanted to do a night walk in Kabukicho to compare the landscape to Kamurocho (Yakuza Series).



\---

Day 16 ‚Äì Nov 19  

\- Ginza Steak in Ebisu for last meal  

\- Return to hotel ‚Üí collect bags  

\- Depart for HND

\- Duty-free shopping  

\- Board Flight



The flight is in the evening, but I might head to HND early afternoon for ease of mind. I haven't explored the airport so that would give me something to do.",https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1n4nqe9/16_day_otaku_solo_trip_in_november_is_it_too_much/,"Sounds mostly solid, I have some feedback on various days:

Day 3: might be too much, you're zooming all across the city literally and starting with a big hike is INTENSE. 

Day 5: No dude, Katsuoji Temple FIRST! That place is so insanely crowded you have to go as the first batch of visitors if you really want to appreciate it trust me it's a whole different experience when you can walk around in silence vs. thousands of kiddos posing for Red Note pics. 

Day 10: Isn't the Shonan Monorail in Kamakura? I suggest doing a day trip to Kamakura and Enoshima it's just not within a reasonable distance from Yokohama. For Yokohama, you MUST go to Chinatown at night, it's stunning with all the lights lit up and the bar/dinner vibes are great its so lively. Red Brick Warehouse is so overrated though, I prefer the World Poiters mall it's so nice has a lot of shops and a surprising selection of international foods.

Day 12: I recommend Small Worlds Museum in Odaiba it's so fun. Not a boring moment in that Museum.",,,,
1n3sbv6,"15 Days in Japan, thoughts?","Ok, so I have been putting together the itinerary for a trip me and a buddy are doing late October and I think I‚Äôve done a decent job fitting in what we‚Äôre looking to do, but was hoping to get some feedback. My buddy is a history buff so it‚Äôs pretty Kyoto heavy - I put quite a bit of work into organizing things near each other and linking them historically, checking days/times they are open, and making sure we have time to do them. We weren‚Äôt planning on spending much time in Tokyo, but since the tail end of the trip would be around Halloween we thought it worth spending at least a few days in Tokyo.

Sun Oct 19 - Arrive in Tokyo
- Fly into Narita at 3:35 PM
- Get to Tokyo Station
- Grab Dinner
- Early to bed

Mon Oct 20th - Tokyo to Kyoto
- Early morning shinkansen to Kyoto
- Visit Nijo Castle
- Visit Kyotogyoen
- Shabu-Shabu Dinner (Reservation)

Tue Oct 21st - Kyoto West

Just be careful with Kyoto, Arashiyama + Kinkaku-ji + Philosopher‚Äôs Path in one day is a lot. Tokyo day with Shinjuku -> Meiji Shrine -> Harajuku -> Shibuya flows nicely. For your Fuji day trip, check [isfujivisible.com](https://isfujivisible.com) while you‚Äôre in Tokyo so you don‚Äôt go on a cloudy day. Kawaguchiko usually gives better views than Hakone.","On days 1 or 2, add in the Osaka Municipal housing museum in Temma. It‚Äôs close to Sky Building and Osaka castle. 

You can experience an Edo period village and learn about old Japan. I highly recommend it to everyone and it‚Äôs something you won‚Äôt see during your other activities. 

After the museum you can walk through Japan‚Äôs oldest shopping arcade for a unique experience.","For Day 8, going from teamLab to Senso-ji to Ginza may be a lot, particularly since you‚Äôre going back and forth on the train (assuming that‚Äôs the order you‚Äôre doing it in).","You and your mom are a lot stronger than me if you can get off a (presumably long) flight and do both Dotonbori and Umeda Sky right away. I would recommend just Dotonbori and take the time to enjoy it. Then replace Umeda Sky with Abeno Harukas on Day 2 as it's very close to Shinsekai (unless you're really into architecture, in which case Umeda Sky is super cool).

Alternatively, it looks like you're basically doing 1 day in Osaka and 3 days in Kyoto, why not just stay in Kyoto and do Osaka as a day trip? Train ride is only about 30-45 mins. There's a train line that goes directly from KIX/Kansai airport to Kyoto station (it's a Hello Kitty train as a bonus). Then it's less checking in and out of hotels. 

Kyoto: I did the Philosopher's Path and unless it's cherry blossom/Sakura season or fall foliage season, it's not really worth doing on its own. I did it as a walk between Ginkaku-ji (the Silver Pavilion) and Eikando and Nanzenji, but if you aren't interested in either then I would skip the Philosopher's Path altogether. Maybe look into Ryoan-ji as you'll be on that side of the city near Kinkaku-ji.

Day 6 - I would take the time to detail whatever the plan is on this day, I'm assuming by Mount Fuji you mean Kawaguchiko? I think it's over 2 hours from Tokyo and it just seems like it's gonna feel bad to take a 2 hour+ shinkansen from Kyoto to Tokyo and then wake up the next morning and go on backwards on a day trip that's 2 hours away. Consider working in an overnight stay in Kawaguchiko or Hakone or doing a different day trip out of Tokyo (unless you really want to see Mt Fuji). 

Tokyo: It seems like you'll have two full days in Tokyo and one half day before your flight. If you think you'll have the energy, you may want to choose two areas in Tokyo and then pack them full of everything you don't want to miss. Start early in the morning in Shinjuku, head down through Shinjuku Gyoen National Garden, down to Meiji Jingu shrine, exit by Harajuku, end in Shibuya. Alternatively, depending on what time you get back from your day trip on Day 6, you could do Shinjuku or Shibuya at night for dinner and exploring.

TeamLab Borderless, Senso-ji (Asakusa), and Ginza are kind of all over the place. Consider doing Senso-ji (Asakusa), Tokyo Skytree, Ueno, and Akihabara on your second full day. On your last half day before your flight, start early at Tsukiji Market, do TeamLab Planets instead of Borderless and finish up in Ginza before heading to the airport.

It's a lot, and way more than I would personally do, but like you said you want to hit every possible spot if it's your mom's only time to Japan.",
1n9tls4,First Time Japan Itinerary Recommendations (November),"Hi everyone, we're heading to Japan for the first time in November for our honeymoon!! Needless to say, we're super excited :)

We‚Äôre going to spend the day here before our flight back the next morning",https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1n9tls4/first_time_japan_itinerary_recommendations/,"Day 3 doesn¬¥t work. Most shops in Akihabara open at 11, soy you basically can't do anything there in the morning. Same with day 5. If you go to Meiji Jingu as early as possible you're gonna have to wait at least until 10 for shops and malls to start opening. The Mugiwara store opens at 11. It works the same for all of Japan.

Day 11- Owakudani and the ropeway are the most important parts of the loop, so I don't get what you mean. You can skip the ship if you want, though it's included in the Hakone Freepass and takes you where you need to go.

Day 21- You should be debating if it's worth it going to Kobe, not Himeji. You can eat Kobe beef (or lots of other wagyu brands) anywhere in Japan. Kobe Motomachidori is just a normal shotengai, same as you can find in any other city, big or small. And Kobe Harborland is kinda meh compared to the Yokohama waterfront, which you have the time to visit from Tokyo. Himeji castle on the other hand is one of the 12 originals remaining, one of the 5 declared national treasures, and the biggest in Japan.","It‚Äôs well paced, the only thing that doesn‚Äôt make sense is to do a daytrip to Kawaguchiko, and then travel from Tokyo to Hakone. 

Both cities are in the fuji five lakes region. So, takes a bus in Kawaguchiko to Gotemba and from there to Hakone. Should take you less than 2 hours and win a day.

Do note most people choose Kawaguchiko or Hakone. But do both of you feel like it. 
If you don‚Äôt mind tweaking your itinerary, I find very rewarding traveling from Kawaguchiko to Matsumoto, visit Kamikochi (in season), then from Matsumoto to Narai/Tsumago/Magome and walk the Nakasendo trail, and end this ‚Äúdetour‚Äù in Nagoya. You will probably need ~4 days to complete this.","I'd fully recommend to everyone (and often do) to find out your estimated jetlag, and if you're going to have any, to go to Kyoto first. The rationale is simple: it's the one place in the golden route where you will be able to do the most popular things early, and dodging a lot of other tourists in the process.

Not a lot open in Tokyo before 10am.","You should account for two things, especially at Narita.

The first is customs. Sometimes customs takes an hour, but I've stood in a Narita customs line for 6+ hours before. So just beware 

The second is travel time from Narita. Depending on when you arrive and then make it through customs, travel from the airport may be a cab only endeavor. Narita is about an hour from Tokyo.

After that, jet lag can really mess you up, so don't overload those first couple of days.

Also, nothing opens til like 9 at the earliest (breakfast, coffee, etc), and sleeping in past about 6a is always hard for the first day or two.",

It's a statutory holiday (Culture Day / Bunka no Hi). DisneySea and day trip places will be packed but there are lots of events at different places around Tokyo, such as at Meiji Jingu.¬†¬†


The Kawaguchiko/Hakone day trip you have, I think you might not be aware how far away those places you list are from each other. I don't think this is doable with public transit. Maybe you want to stay overnight in Kawaguchiko, and/or either skip Hakone or make a separate day trip out of it.¬†","For eight nights, staying in Tokyo and doing day trips to places like Kamakura is a very sensible alternative to splitting time between Tokyo and Kansai.

Agreed with other commenter that you should map many of these places out. On Day 3, Hakone is nowhere near Kawaguchiko, and if you're just going for an onsen, there are plenty nearby. And Day 4 has you ping pinging across the city multiple times.

There are so many districts in Tokyo - you'll have no trouble filling up Day 7 by looking at some other itineraries. If I were you, I might even cut one of the day trips like Kawagoe and spend more time in Tokyo - between your three day trips and Disneyland, you only have 3 full days in Tokyo. Which is fine if the day trips are important to you, but I bet you'll find plenty to fill your Tokyo time with.","You expect  to arrive at Narita at 1500 and be at your hotel in Shinjuku or Shibuya by 1700?

That's highly unlikely. Both locations are more than one hour away from Narita and on top of that it depends on queues to pass through immigration. 

If you add at least an hour or two to your estimate it's more plausible.","Nice, I am planning a trip to Tokyo for the same duration. I wanted to do Osaka like you but the transit time and cost is not worth it for this duration of trip. I'll speak to what I have experience with.

Day 1: I always choose to land earlier than later, giving me more time to shower, unpack, unwind, and perhaps a break before dinnertime. Coming from West US, I have to stay up until bedtime, and the extra time gets me more tired. I tend to have a lot of adrenaline the first night anyways so that's how I roll. 14:00 is perfect IMO. For dinner, you literally can't go wrong with anywhere, I personally would choose the closest neighborhood, grab a bite and sightsee a bit. If you want high energy, those are fine, but those two locations are some of the most busiest during dinnertime. I would choose Shinjuku if you want to go in the deep end, and pair Shibuya with Harujuku in another day.

Day 2: Nakameguro has great vibes at night.

Day 4: A little scattered. Asakusa Ueno could be it's own day or 2/3 of a day. Meiji is normally paired with Harajuku and Yoyogi park and with Shibuya nearby, you can consider that a day. Daikanyama is fine, but I personally prefer something more exciting for night, it's a nice daytime stroll though.

Day 6: Heed other commenter's note on Culture Day.

Day 8: I would go to other places you haven't seen, but I remember my first time there I did visit it multiple times, just cause it's big, and cause it feels like a ""safe"" bet for a tourist.

Some places to consider are along the westbound JR Chuo Line. Nakano, Koenji, Kichijoji, Asagaya. All have places worth sightseeing for tourists, but a bit chiller and more local of a place than the typical big names.

Also if you move Disneyland, don't put it on a weekend. Big mistake I made.",

My husband and I are planning our first trip to Japan (October 22 - Nov 6) and would love any and all advice.

Hoping this trip will be a blend of: nature/hiking, food, Japanese history (art, museums and temples) as well as modern day Japanese culture. We're not super interested in shopping, anime, theme parks or bars (neither of us drink).

All advice is appreciated. I know this subreddit can get a bit ~intense~ when it comes to ambitious itineraries, and this is definitely an itinerary that bounces around A LOT.

",https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1mt24f9/16_day_trip_to_japan_oct_nov/,"My advice is always hotel over airbnb, especially in japan.

Many locals hate airbnbers because they don't recycle correctly (and it's complicated) or are too loud so your ""neighbours"" may not be giving you the most welcoming looks. And if you need immediate assistance, the host may not speak English which makes it more inconvenient. Not to mention you don't have the option of leaving your luggage with the hotel after checking out, or leaving them before checking in, which I think is an important factor if you don't want to carry all your things around. And if anything not working at the airbnb, you're screwed, there is no other room for you to switch to, no help will be provided. I don't think airbnb is worth the hassle.

Some of your days are very packed, Harajuku, Shibuya and Shinjuku all on the same day seem insane especially things don't open until after 10 and you said you don't like nightlife much, which means each place you only have perhaps 3 hours or so to explore. Not exactly a lot of time considering those are the biggest districts of Tokyo.

You need to be very specific about the flights, are you landing and flying out of Haneda? When you say 2 hours is it arrival at 17:00 and departure at 19:00? If that's the case, absolutely not advisable, you likely won't make it. If you fly first class you may leave the plane quickly (economy takes up to 30min depending on your seats) but that still depends on how busy the airport is, the plane may need to stay on the apron for a while before getting connected to the terminal, even if it lands on time. Customs is going to be 45min at least from my recent experience, but you need to get to the gate at least 30mim before departure otherwise the gate will close so yah 2 hours will be very tight leaving no room for delay.","Two hours is a bit dicey and yours looks like its already under two hours - customs can be very quick or very slow at Haneda depending on how many other planes have landed.¬† Your best bet is to make a beeline straight for customs as soon as the plane spits you out to beat all the 300 people flying with you. This is what I did and was able to clear it in 20 minutes but depends on your luck. You are also vulnerable to any potential delays on your first flight. This seems like an anxiety inducing start to your trip, I would recommend just booking a longer transit.


It's just the two of you so why not just stay in the hotel instead of contributing to a worse housing situation for locals?


Its a long way to Koyasan so definitely consider either staying the night or skipping it.¬†


Nara and Miyajima have different attractions, whether or not it'll feel like missing out depends on you though. On a two weel trip, seems okay to do one or the other.¬†


The tea drinking hike could be the Nakasendo trail? Is it a rest house in the middle where you can stop for tea?


Your Kyoto itineraries look really packed. You'll need to book ahead for Kokedera as they limit visitors.¬†


Gotokuji is a bit outside the central area of Tokyo so it'll take time to get there. Same with Kegon Falls/Lake Chuzenji in Nikko.","We are pretty much going the same dates! But we are doing :

Okinawa - 4 nights,
Osaka 2 nights,

My husband and I are planning our first trip to Japan (October 22 - Nov 6) and would love any and all advice.

Hoping this trip will be a blend of: nature/hiking, food, Japanese history (art, museums and temples) as well as modern day Japanese culture. We're not super interested in shopping, anime, theme parks or bars (neither of us drink).

All advice is appreciated. I know this subreddit can get a bit \~intense\~ when it comes to ambitious itineraries, and this is definitely an itinerary that bounces around A LOT. It's acting more as a catch all, and I am excited to heed your advice, as obviously those who have traveled to these places know better!

\----------------------------------------------------------------------

Our itinerary is not final yet, so we‚Äôd really appreciate any advice or recommendations you might have.

* Is it worth spending 1 night in Fujikawaguchiko? Our idea for now is just a day trip, renting a car in Otsuki to have more flexibility to visit different spots.
* On the other hand, we thought about renting a car in Takayama to go to Shirakawa-go and then to Kanazawa. Even if it is more expensive than the bus, it will give us more freedom to see some villages in the area and enjoy it more. Do you think it‚Äôs worth adding 1 more night in Takayama/Kanazawa? From where would you remove it?
* We are not interested in visiting Hiroshima, but we do want to see Himeji. Is Miyajima worth it as a day/afternoon trip?
* We already booked a ryokan in Takayama (Honjin Hiranoya). Do you think it‚Äôs worth it or are there better ones? We don‚Äôt mind the price since this will be our relax day/night (after all, it‚Äôs our honeymoon).
* Which places would you add or remove from this itinerary?

If you‚Äôre still here, thank you so much for taking time to read our plan and for your advice :)",https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1n6mkvx/my_first_trip_to_japan_3weeks_itinerary/,"You may need to find that you‚Äôre going to have to sprinkle in some slower days.  All of this is doable and some busier than others, but unless you‚Äôre used to being out and about for 10-12 hours a day for 3 weeks straight, the days themselves might be possible, but stacked on top of each other it can add up.","What things most interest you about Japan? What are your favorite things to do while traveling? Do you like the bustling city environment or the calmness of the countryside? You & your spouse.

That will dictate how long to spend where.","Way way way too many things planned, remove half the stuff if you don't want to just run from one thing to another without enjoying",I'm thinking of a somewhat similar itinerary but instead thinking of starting in Hiroshima and making my way to Tokyo. Will do Hiroshima - Osaka - Kyoto - Kanazawa (not decided) - Tokyo <> Hakone,"This is giving me post Japan holiday blues. I went to Japan last November from the 10th to the 29th with my partner. 

One thing I will say is try not to plan too much on the first day as tiredness may likely catch up with you. However you arrive in the mornings you may be ok. I underestimated how tired we'd be after an 18+ hour flight from the UK and ended up skipping part of our itinerary for that day.

Whilst I didn't go to Nikko, I've seen many people say a day trip is not long enough due to the travel time required.

You're in Tokyo for several days but don't actually spend much time in Tokyo. There's so much to see. I regret not staying longer. For Kamakura, you could try adding Enoshima instead of Yokohama as they're so close together it makes perfect sense to go to both.

Regarding Kawaguchiko, we stayed for one night in a Ryokan and wish we made it two because the area and the hotel was so nice we didn't get to enjoy it fully due to the traveling and arriving in the afternoon later than expected. We hired bikes and cycled to the Maple Corridor the next day, which had a festival on at the time. Also, due to the poor weather, we couldn't see Fuji on the 2nd day. So, prepare to be potentially disappointed.

If you want to go to Miyajima (I'd recommend it, it was one of our favourite places) I'd recommend staying on the island for the night. The crowds were heaving during the day. Staying on the island allowed us to take the ropeway without waiting for too long. When we came back down, the waiting time must have been for over an hour."

The Male is for leg meat mostly but very expensive. You'll find lots of crabs in the Omicho market. It's so special because you have to be in Kanazawa for a specific time of the year. Find a local sushi place or even from fish stores in the Omicho and order boiled koubako. This is my top food that I miss from my home.

   *  coming back and having one night full stay in Osaka, in Namba region, maybe in a capsule hotel, enjoying fun night out, heard Club Under is fun :)
* 29 - Shinkansen to Tokyo
* 29,30,1,2, 3 Tokyo - Staying in another part, maybe Akasaka or Ginza, very likely a Kamakura day trip on one day, and one day just for souvenir shopping
   * 30.09 - Kamakura day trip
   * 01.10 visiting Asakusa, Senso-ji Hozomon Gate, Ueno Park, Yanaka Ginza
   * 02.10 Ginza walking, imperial palace Z≈çj≈ç-ji, Hie Shrine, Akasaka and some souvenir shopping
   * 03.10 checkout and enjoying last hours before going to airport at around 6 pm
* 03.10 Departure from Tokyo 10:50 pm local time

So the general Plan is to get lost in Shibuya and Shinjuku for first 2 days, than enjoy Kyoto and Osaka for couple of more, have a break for one day in Kinosaki Ryokan Onsen and after that with short night in Osaka, return to Tokyo to visit part East from Imperial Palace (opposite to staying on the West the first time)

Questions to you:

* Do you think that I would benefit from some kind of rail pass due to travels in between cities - like Hokuriku Arch Pass?
* In general what kind of metro tickets should I get in Tokyo for the first two days and later?
* Are the choices right for the first time visit, or should I use the time to travel to some other places?
* Any other tips that might be helpful?

Thank you for all the tips! ",https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1mp4jr9/first_time_in_japan_traveling_from_germany_14/,"1. No.  The Horiku Arch Pass is a five hour trip thru Kanazawa to get to Kyoto.  To make it worth it you have to do the round trip.  For the same price you can just buy a Shinkansen ticket that goes straight between Tokyo and Kyoto and is 2 hrs one way.
2. No, use an IC card to pay for rides.  You can buy a metro pass that‚Äôs only good on some lines.  Savings not worth the trouble.
3. Go to the places you want to go to.
4. Read the sub and r/japantraveltips",">Do you think that I would benefit from some kind of rail pass due to travels in between cities - like Hokuriku Arch Pass?

there is a online calculator somewhere to see if any rail pass is worth the money (you put in your days and locations). for me it looks like its not worth it for you

>In general what kind of metro tickets should I get in Tokyo for the first two days and later?

we just used suica card in the apple wallet.  super easy

>Senbon Torii, walk around Kyoto,

we did this in the evening and it rained a bit. less tourist, incredible mood and soundscape. magic 

>Are the choices right for the first time visit, or should I use the time to travel to some other places?

seems solid. don't try to run from spot to spot. you don't have to see everything.  
if you want to more feedback do you have any special interests?

>Any other tips that might be helpful?

we preferred shinjuku overshibuya when it comes to food and evening/nightlife (mid 30's opinion).  
some temples/shrines are open at night and beautiful lit. sometimes worth it to flee the masses

>walking around Kyoto - here question, what do you think would be chill thing to do? I don't want to overdo it with attractions.

visit a sento to be naked with the locals and refresh and relax from all the walking/sightseeing","I think you can venture out more the first two days rather than staying in Shibuya and Shinjuku. Consider going to Daikanyama, Yanaka Ginza for a change in scenery. But if you like hustle and bustle then check out ueno or ikebukiro.","i think the plan is amazing! however, often it does not go the way how you want it to as there are a lot of interesting stuff on the side which could disrupt your plan so the best advice for you might be to go with the flow and enjoy every moment !","Re jet lag, don‚Äôt sleep on your plane so that you‚Äôll be exhausted and sleep well the first night.  The first day is very important."

Thanks everyone!",https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1n81iv1/group_of_5_first_timers_going_for_2_weeks/,"Seems sane compared to most I see on this sub. Do not hesitate to do things separately when opinions don't align, even if it's solo. Best way to enjoy yourself and avoid pointless arguments.

Also, teamLab Borderless is better than Planets, so do that instead.","Osaka is a good base for the first leg of your trip. You would save a ton of time booking a one day tour and knocking out most of the places on your list. Check out Klook for options, like this [Kyoto and Nara day tour](https://s.klook.com/c/lyNNYvkJyr) with lunch included. Also recommend checking out the Cup Noodles museum in Osaka.

With the extra time, you might be able to squeeze in a quick train ride to Hiroshima to see the Castle, Atomic Bomb Dome, Peace Museum, Peace Memorial Park, and Okonomimura food hall.

Recommendations for Tokyo:

-Tsukiji market (great street food, you might end up going there on multiple days)

-Book lunch at restaurant run by former sumo wrestlers [Yokozuna Tonkatsu Dosukoi Tanaka](https://dosukoi-tanaka.com/)

I know you didn't ask, but check out the local hotel chains. Highly recommend Dormy Inns.

Enjoy!","Looks good. I would definitely trade one day of Osaka for one more day in Kyoto.  This is preference but you can easily do Osaka in 2,5 √† 3 days, while I find the calm you get from an extra day in Kyoto can't be found elsewhere easily. Just doing philosophers path on a chill ritme takes half a day easy !

Also, if you take the Shinkansen from Kyoto to Tokyo, can't u stop at Fuji then ?",,

Maybe you can also consider a day trip to Shirakawa-go (like Hida folk village, but an actual historical one, UNESCO world heritage).

Or you can consider Kanazawa instead - it‚Äôs easier to get to from Tokyo / to Kyoto (basically a counterclockwise loop) and it has an amazing top 3 garden, castle, historic geisha / samurai districts, market and a number of great museums. You can also do a day trip to Shirakawa-go from there as well.",Takayama is my favorite city in Japan and I always wish I had more time there. I stayed there a week on my most recent trip and could‚Äôve stayed there longer.,You have plenty of time in Kyoto and Takayama is well worth your time.,Takayama gets my vote!,
1muhud9,Itinerary Check: Osaka > Kyoto > Tokyo (Sept. 10th to 30th),"Hey everyone, just about finalized our itinerary for our upcoming trip, and looking for any and all input or advice. Are we doing too much? Is there something you think we should shuffle around or add/remove? My plan was to have options everyday, but not necessarily something we have to do if we want to pivot. We have a bunch of stuff booked already, and still need to book Shibuya Sky. The last thing, I think, we need to do before we leave, is book all train tickets. Namely the Shinkansen between cities, and nail down our Mt. Fuji travel. This I will do first week of September I think. Itinerary below.

They‚Äôre also super dangerous and cringy anyway.","Why are you revisiting Uji on the 18th if you‚Äôre already going to be there the evening of the 16th? The 18th already has a lot going on and you will likely be too exhausted to travel all the way back down there anyway. 

On the 17th: You should plan to explore downtown Kyoto and Pontocho after your tea ceremony since you‚Äôll be right in/near both. Then you can just focus on wandering around Gion during the evening of the 18th and enjoy the nighttime atmosphere.","I think it is really good but i would try and avoid making it too packed, as you can definitely explore a lot from just wandering around which often does not put into schedule as it is more spontaneous so i would try and make sure that you get max freedom!","Yea I was looking into Hakone as well, would love to see the race track there.

E.g I could easily spend back to back days in Akiba but I also know people who aren't really interested and wanna leave quickly. 
Depends on what you like.
Also *if* you are big into the pop culture stuff there's also nakanp Broadway and ikebukuro","Hakone is wonderful, but bear in mind that if you want to make all the transport route you might need to go early and have tight schedule. People do it, you can find many posts over this Reddit, but I prefered to spend the night at the middle and have more time at places like the open-air museum. 

Daytrip to Nara was one of my favourite parts of the trip, so it's worth it. People usually suggest to combine this with an early visit on the morning to Fushimi Inari as they share a train line and it's one of the things usually considered a must at Kyoto. I my case, I went at sunset after Uji at a last minute decission.","Regarding staying somewhere in Tokyo, I‚Äôd suggest staying literally anywhere with a good deal that‚Äôs right next to a station on the Yamanote line, you can get pretty much anywhere quite quickly and personally I prefer to stay out the way of the busy areas just so I can get a good nights sleep so I often choose Hamamatsucho","Food for thought since you are splitting Tokyo on both end of your trip. You could adjust it and say for the first part of Tokyo, focus on the east side - ie Asakusa, Akihabara, Ginza, Imperial Palace, Toyosu etc and stay at a hotel on this side. Kuramae is also a very cool neighbourhood to explore on the east side of Tokyo. 

Then on your return, you can focus on the west side of Tokyo - Shibuya, Shinjuku, Harajuku etc. Daikanyama and Ebisu are worth checking out if you have time.",
1nc3wtz,Japan Itinerary  27 Nights - Started in 2012,"Well here is my Itinerary for my Ultimate Japanese Trip with my adult son aged 31.  I started planning it in 2012 and had everything booked in 2020 and 2021 and the Pandemic ended that. So now 13 years later I have continued to perfect it, but I still had to cut down some time in Japan in order to visit Vietnam, Thailand, Singapore, and South Korea which I have decided to visit as well due to the long time it took me to acutally be able to do this trip. Any suggestions are welcome! I have purposely decided not to visit some places that I feel are just not worthy of my time, and I don't want to visit every temple and shrine in Japan either.  Avoiding like the plague all overpriced tourist trap tours.. Sumo Wrestling, Geisha Performances, Food tours, Ninja Restaurants, Go Karts etc. In fact no tours at all.  I did want to see the Robot show in Kabukicho however its been changed. I'm still debating about a Maid Cafe experience due to its uniqueness. Hotels in Japan are very expensive on Saturdays so I have had to work around that, and budget constraints. I have also tried to visit certain places on weekdays to avoid crowds.  We are staying as close to train stations as possible at most of our acomodations. Our Hotel in Ikebukuro for instance is 300 Meters from the station.

1nbzsgc,"Japan Trip, first-timer: 22 days, Oct-Nov 2025. Feedback on Itinerary","Hi! :)

I am planning a 22-day travel to Japan with my partner from October 20 to November 10. We think our itinerary is packed but doable. We are both really good walkers (used to hiking a lot), will travel by train and have JR pass, love thematic parks and themed cafes, nature and animals, are big foodies (like local food) and wanted to see as many different big cities as we could for our first travel. We were however wondering if transportation-wise we can do everything we want to do as planned, and if there are better ways to move around and do the activities we‚Äôd like. We were also wondering if you had any suggestions for activities for the cities mentioned (places to eat, fun small museums, nature activities, etc). We have a lot of days where not much is planned.  Here‚Äôs our itinerary:

Day 1: Arrival in Tokyo  at 3:25 pm. Explore the city a bit.

Day 2: Sanrio Puroland, stop at Shimokitazawa and Gotokuji on the way back

Day 3: Teamlab Planets, maybe UNKO museum, Shibuya (maybe Bar Acra)

Day 4: Moomin Valley Park, Tove Jansson Akebono Children's Forest Park

Day 5: Teamlab Borderless, taking the Saphir Odoriko train to Ito

Day 6: Hagachizaki Monkey Bay

Day 7:  Take train to Osaka

Day 8: Osaka Aquarium Kaiyukan (maybe), Honke Shibato

Day 9: Universal Studios

Day 10: Free day. Wondering if we should take one more day in Osaka or Kyoto, or if there is another place near that we could go to that you would recommend. (Maybe village of Amami with Nanten-en ryokan and Q-emon cafe)

Day 11: Legoland

Day 12: Ghibli Park, take train to Kyoto

Day 13: Kyoto Railway Museum, Sagano Scenic Railway, Thousand Gates, Arashiyama Bamboo Forest

Day 14: Nara Deer Park

Day 15: TeamLab Biovortex, take train to Kure

Day 16: Take train to Fukuoka (either spend more time in Kure or Fukuoka)

Day 17: Dazaifu Tenmangu

Day 18: Take train to Kanazawa

Day 19: Kenrokuen Garden, Kanazawa Castle, Nagamachi Samurai District, Omicho Market (Canteen Sh≈çroku)

Day 20: Take train to Nagano

Day 21: Jigokudani Monkey Park, Yudanaka Onsen Yoroduya

Day 22: Take train to Tokyo, flight at 6:45 pm

All suggestions welcome! üòä

\*Edited to remove animal cafe/zoos/aquarium, but left the nature parks for now.

\*\*Edited to add some recommendations",https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1nbzsgc/japan_trip_firsttimer_22_days_octnov_2025/,"Don‚Äôt buy the JR pass without first using an online calculator to confirm it‚Äôs worthwhile - they rarely are since the huge price hike in 2023.

Also, don‚Äôt go to animal cafes, unless you think animal cruelty is cool. Japanese animal welfare standards are unfortunately rather weak.

For the Fukuoka leg of the trip, I suspect that you‚Äôre using an AI service as they are clueless about Dazaifu and Nanzoin both actually being well outside of Fukuoka and almost impossible to combine in a day. Canal City also sucks - it‚Äôs a faded mall, but AI itineraries always include it. Fukuoka has lots of interesting temples and much better malls, so don‚Äôt use the AI recommendations.

What are you planning on doing in Kure? It has some good maritime museums, but not much else. 

This generally seems rather hectic. You‚Äôll spend a lot of time travelling.",I recommend not immediately crashing as soon as you get to your hotel day one. Drop off your stuff then explore the area. If you go to bed at a normal hour it'll help your jet lag and help you adjust to the local time better. But if you go to bed at like 6pm when you arrive at your hotel you'll wake up at 3am and not know what to do.,"Day 2: On your way from Tokyo to Sanrio Puroland, you'll pass by Shimokitazawa and Gotokuji. Get off on your way back to hotel.

Day 4: Have you checked out ‚ÄùTove Jansson Akebono Children's Forest Park‚Äù? It's in the nearby area, and free to enter.",Glad to see a meaningful amount of time in Tokyo. I love the city and it‚Äôs my favorite part of Japan. Recommend Bar Acra in Shibuya.,
1mz5s6f,"17 day solo trip - Osaka, Kyoto, Tokyo (Oct/Nov) - too ambitious?","Hi all! I will be in Japan 10/22 - 11/8.

I have some flexibility on activities, but hotels are booked already.

I like historical, culture sites, food, and also just wandering around. I like anime and am a avid BL (yaoi) fan. Any recs for that? I'm not a huge shopper but I am looking for a kitchen knife, ceramic dishes, and maybe some clothes? I am looking for some neat souvenirs that aren't useless knick knacks. I hate clutter and dont want to buy something that'll just get stashed in a drawer.

  
I know my trip has some very tourist spots esp. kyoto but I figured it's my first time so why not. There's always future trips to explore more.

I havent made reservations for any activities or restuaurants yet. I think only the teamLabs will need them. For food I don't plan to go to any michelin star places but I am looking for good quality sushi and wagyu beef. Will I need reservations for that? (Please send any recs my way!) In general, is it better to plan what restaurants I'll go to before hand or is winging it okay?

Appreciate any feedback or suggestions. Are some days are too packed? Should I combine or skip certain activities? Should I re-arrange anything?

Himeji is easily a whole day and if you would like to go to Kobe aswell, don't do Umeda. But: You can eat Kobe beef also in Osaka. So if you only go because of the beef, just do Himeji and go back to Osaka. 

10/25 - lots of typos, just make sure that you have the right names - Shinsaibashi and Dotonbori. 

10/29 - thats quite a lot of stuff you plan. Arashiyama is easily a full day. Please check distances and how long you need to travel on that day! Expect busses to be delayed! 

11/01 - Muji and Uniqlo are everywhere in Tokyo and as far as I remember, the stores in Ginza are very crowded and more expensive than lots of other stores. And: You will find exactly the same articles everywhere. 

11/02 - same for the Donki. Check another one which is not that crowded! This day is doable but again: lots and lots of steps! 

11/03 - Nakamise dori opens at 9:00 / 9:30. 

11/04 and 05 - Check the distances and bus timetables. I'm pretty sure that the first day is not doable. And I guess it's the Fairfield by Mariott Tochigi Nikko. Just to make sure that you will find it on Google Maps. 

Which airport will you be leaving in Tokyo? If it's NRT, I would suggest you to stay at an airport hotel the night before departure (e.g. Hotel Nikko Narita) and do shopping in Narita City at the Aeon Mall. You have a Donki and Uniqlo and the Aeon Mall itself. The prices are lower than in the Donki and Uniqlo you mentioned.","I'd skip Umeda, unless it's improved in the last few years I was very very underwhelmed.","i think overall your itinerary looks solid for a first-timer!   
you‚Äôve got the right balance of ‚Äúfamous spots‚Äù and local flavor. Just a heads-up: for wagyu/sushi, most of the really good mid-range places in Osaka and Tokyo don‚Äôt take months ahead reservations, but they *do* get busy, so I‚Äôd recommend booking 1‚Äì2 days in advance once you‚Äôre in Japan (Google Maps and Tabelog work great for this). 

For Fushimi Inari, 8am is good but if you can push it to 6-7am you‚Äôll basically have the mountain to yourself. And since you‚Äôre into anime/BL, definitely check Shibuya Parco‚Äôs anime floor and Ikebukuro‚Äôs Otome Road, it‚Äôs a niche highlight that a lot of tourists miss.","I was actually just looking up things to do while in tokyo and osaka, i'm stealing the majority of this list, thanks for doing the leg work lol","10/23- You can try Kobe or any other wagyu (some of which are even better) anywhere in Japan. You don't need to go to Kobe for that. Instead you can go from Himeji to Fukusaki and walk around town finding all of the yokai and taking pictures of them. You'll be able to walk through the countryside and in non touristy places.

10/25- Probably too much.

10/31- If you like anime you can easily spend the whole day or even more in Akiba checking out stores. If you feel you're done you can head to Ameyoko.

11/1- Same as with Kobe, you don't need Tsukiji. You can find that food everywhere without going out of your way and without the crowds of tourists. Uniqlo and Muji are literally everywhere, don't worry about a specific store.

11/2- Takeshita is kinda a tourist trap now, and extremely crowded. You should visit the alleys around it and Cat St. And again, don't worry about Donki. It's everywhere.

11/3- Avoid the zoo if you care about the animals. You probably won't even have time for it.

11/5- That's a wasted day. You don't need a full hour on the boat. Just take it from shore to shore and continue exploring. You have Kegon waterfall before the lake, then the cruise to the Sh≈çbugahama beach pier to visit Ryuzu falls. You can hike from there through Senjogahara Marshland, passing through Yudaki falls, around Yunoko lake to Yumoto. Or skip the hike and take a bus to Yumoto. You have a free footh bath, the visitor center, and you can check the sulphur coming out of the soil at the back of the town. At the very least visit the waterfalls around the lake."
1mwykwr,Tokyo 8 nights,"Less than a month away, just throwing my itinerary out there. 

Day 1 (wed)- Flying into HND @ 2pm. Booked a limousine bus to drop me off at my hotel, Tobu Hotel Levant for 4:45 pm, I hope that will be enough time to clear custom and get some cash. Find a place to eat, walk around the hotel, try to stay up until around 9 or 10 pm to fight jet lag. 

Day 2 (thu)- Sensoji Temple, shop around for a cooking knife, Skytree at 5pm.

Day 3 (fri)- Fuji tour, 8am-6pm.

Day 4 (sat)- team lab planets, small worlds miniature museum, Gundam base in Odaiba

Day 5 (sun)- Shibuya, nothing really planned, any suggestion welcomed. Going to a car meet at Daikoku at 5:30 pm and this is the pick up point. 

Day 6 (mon)- Anime/game shopping, Akahabara and Nakano Broadway. 

Day 7 (tue)- Disney Sea, I'm from Anaheim and used to work at Disneyland, always thought about visiting the 'best' Disney park, so here I am. 

Day 8 (wed)- no plan, more shopping maybe, fancy restaurant, any suggestion welcomed.

Day 9 (thu)- flying out at 6pm.

  
I know, I'm doing all the super touristy thing, but I'm not brave enough to just get on a train and wander around a neighborhood on my first trip. Any tips, suggestion welcomed. Thanks.  ",https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1mwykwr/tokyo_8_nights/,"To be honest, keep your intinerary. It¬¥s really nice and gives you plenty of spontaneous adventures. One of the few intineraries here that are doable :)",Shibuya and Nakano are very close to each other while Nakano and Akihabara are on opposite sides of the city.,"For sensoji temple, check out Tokyo Free Walking Tours for a free english tour. You need to make a reservation if it sounds interesting to you.

Ginza is a very nice shopping area if that interests you. Seiko Museum is there too, you can also take a free self guided tour here with reservations. Tokyo Station is also not that far of a walk from Ginza. There's also this cool Art Aquarium Museum you need to buy tickets for.

Tsukiji fish market is pretty close to Ginza, too. At the fish market, there are a lot of little vendors and food. It's best to go around 7AM if you would prefer to go when there's less people.

As for your free day, check out Sunshine City or consider going to Yokohama! Sunshine City has more shopping, there's an aquarium, a planetarium, and a lot of gacha! Sunshine City has events, too, but you have to check their calendar. Yokohama has a Cup Noodle Factory Museum and amusement park. There's an air cabin ride, too.","I like your itinerary, the best part of traveling is allowing yourself to explore and find something you like unexpectedly",
1mwv2wj,[Itinerary Check] Mostly Solo trip of 6 weeks in June/July 2026,"So this ""Itinerary"" It's still more of a draft than anything, I don't even have the plane tickets yet, but I have more or less confirmed that I could make a trip of this lenght, so now I'm trying to gauge how much time will each place require. And also seeking some opinions on places I'm not fully convinced or could be missing for going solo.

Some context:  
Why go on Summer? The one who was going to Japan originally was my dad, and because of his job could only go on Summer or Winter, he chose Summer.  
And so when he told me he was going, I decided to go with him, at least on the same plane since I've never gone outside my country(Argentina), neither done or planned a long trip like this either, so going alone for everything was a little too much. Plus he has lived in Japan for like a year, so it was overall convenient except for the heat of summer that will surely kill me if I don't start doing more excercise now.  
Still, my dad will be mostly on Kyoto for most of the time, that's why mostly solo trip.

As for the itinerary itself, I listed places of interests that I saw from youtube videos, like Abroad in Japan, and some coworkers recommendations. I'm missing listing some activities on Tokyo that I still have to research more. Also dropped places like Nikko or North Japan in general because they're more like winter or autumn places. Another clarification it's I was thinking starting just like 1-2 days in Tokyo, then kind of like Kanazawa -> Takayama -> Kyoto -> Osaka and from there somehow visit the rest of other places further down and then return to Tokyo and stay there till the end.

And the most controversial place I want opinions on is Okinawa, my dad doesn't think it's worth going, he hasn't been there despite having lived in Japan.  
I'm mainly interested in trying out diving and such, although i'm not sure how it works in terms of reservations and stuff, some things require a license I read. Aside from that, i'm not really a beach/pool guy, can't even swim properly, it's been years since I've been to one.

Lastly opinions on Fukuoka and Nagasaki? I removed them at some point because I had less days in mind at the beginning.

P.S: I forgot to mention, but I have watched an absurd amount of anime, so any kind of pilgrimage that I could do while on my trip that you recommend, feel free to mention. I'm planning on visiting Kobe to see the Fate Stay/Night places like the bridge and mantions.

Probably should have made different posts, but oh well... hoping it doesn't get deleted as soon as I press post.

>Lastly opinions on Fukuoka and Nagasaki? I removed them at some point because I had less days in mind at the beginning.

They're a fun visit. But you're on vacation, so focus on quality time instead of quantity. 

For solo, the real starting question is the cost. If you have a set budget, or unlimited budget in mind. Being alone is expensive unless you want to just do hostels. The routes you have picked can add up pretty fast. You could buy a JR pass, but that in itself is pretty expensive.



Fatigue and loneliness is also something to factor in. Going in the summer is hot, and you can't really do as much as if it was winter or early spring (unless you're used to the heat and humidity)? My friend went on his first summer solo and got extremely exhausted and lonely pretty fast. 

Consider cutting out some cities, adding a relax - cooldown - laundry and chill day every 7-8 days. You'll burn yourself out fast, if you need to speed run every single day.

I've soloed japan many times across 30-90 days. It's all about balance.","Not sure Osaka warrants 4 days. Like, Osaka castle? Meh... Maybe just check the outside, but don't bother paying to go in, it's not great, especially since you're already going to Himeji.

And since you enjoy weeb crap, you might want to check out DenDen Town - might get you some better deals than in Tokyo, where you'll be paying premium.

As for Okinawa, I've got questions... I mean, you say you ""can't even swim properly"", yet you want to go diving? I'm not sure I follow. Maybe go swimming in Argentine first? See if you can survive that. As for booking a diving session, you could try and use [https://www.klook.com](https://www.klook.com)","There are vast numbers of restaurants in Tokyo and other cities in Japan, so I'd suggest being more flexible about where you eat - unless you're interested in fine dining and the like, you don't need to plan meals in advance given standards are pretty high. For instance, why travel well outside of central Tokyo to go to Udatsu Sushi? There are lots of perfectly good sushi places that don't require you to travel far. I suspect that you're under-estimating just how big Tokyo is.

Hiroshima needs more than a day.

I'd agree that it seems unusual that you want to go to Okinawa to go to the beaches and go snorkelling or scuba diving given you say that you don't like beaches much and aren't good at swimming.","Hey, there is nothing wrong with your draft right now. I¬¥m just curious on why you choose the ""main"" Cities for your trip so far and why you are giving yourself only a few days there, when you are travelling for 6 Weeks? 6 Weeks sounds like a dream for me. I would stay longer in each city and explore the more hidden cities and villages and won¬¥t be bothered by travelling time at all.

What I mean is: there is a significant distance between Tokyo and Kanazawa. Why not travel around Nagano Prefecture? Summer is so hot in Japan, the mountains will provide some milder temperature. While you are there you could do Takayama etc and then hit Kanazawa. Also, Kanazawa to Kyoto is also a long road. You could stay in Fukui Prefecture, which is not so popular among tourists, but I found an awesome temple there with the best Purin in my life. And on your way to Kyoto from Fukui, there are some more cities near lake Biwa. I¬¥ve never been, but they all sound sooooo interesting. And ther is another HUGE gap between Osaka and Hirosshima! Along the way, you could see so many Cities I¬¥ve been and want to go! Like Kobe, Himeji (himeji castle!!!!), Okayama and so many more.

  
And... why are you traveling from Hiroshima to Hakone and then to Okinawa? You are already south, why not travel further south like to Fukuoka and take a flight from there to Okinawa? You could also explore Kyushu before that flight to Okinawa.

  
For real, your 6 weeks are a dream amount of time for a japan trip. Do you already have an accomodation for Tokyo?

  
Man... i should stop rambling. I¬¥m sorry, if I sounded rude, I¬¥m just VERY excited for you and english is not my first language. Have fun planning!!!","The logistics will be better and cheaper if you do the following order:

Tokyo -> Nagano -> Matsumoto -> Takayama -> (Shirakawa-go) -> Kanazawa - Kyoto -> (then rest of your itinerary)

Nagano has Zenkoji, Jigokudani snow monkey park, Togakushi Shrine (half day trip to mountain area with majestic cedar-lined pilgrimage road, will be nice and cooler in the summer).

Nagano is on the same Shinkansen line going counterclockwise from Tokyo to Kanazawa, and you can go west towards Kyoto in the order above give the cities you want to hit.

Matsumoto is a super charming, compact town, natural Japanese Alps spring water flowing throughout. But a day trip from Tokyo is not feasible; I would definitely stay at least 2-3 nights, especially if you want to do a day trip to Narai-juku, in addition to the castle and many other sights in Matsumoto town itself.

For Matsumoto to Takayama: Look up and book the reserved bus times (open a month in advance) as the connection is by reserved bus; no trains). Tickets can be QR code on your phone, very simple.

You may also want to consider Kamikochi, which is an alpine valley considered one of the most scenic nature spots in Japan. It sits halfway between Matsumoto and Takayama and can be done as a day trip on your way between those two towns.

Takayama to Kanazawa: you can also take bus in the morning to Shiragawa-ko, do the day visit, then at the end of your day, take the bus to Kanazawa. You can store luggage for the day at Shiragawa-ko.

Generally central Japan towns above are Japanese Alps mountain towns ‚Äî they will be cooler due to elevation and mountain greenery, so look into allocating more time in this area."
1mvf3t7,Itinerary check and advice for November trip to Japan,"I am going to Japan with a buddy of mine (specifically Tokyo, Kyoto, Osaka - I know; basic asf) from Nov 5 to Nov 17 for a total of 13 days inclusive of the days in which I travel to and from my home country. I decided to do my own research and create my own itinerary as well as search for dorms/hostels/chain hotels so that we can do most of our spending on experiences and travel within the country. I wanted your advice on several things such as whether we have packed too many things into one day or if some days are too free and more could be seen. I also wanted advice on whether or not some of the things in this list are as worth it and if there any other alternatives/better options within the city I should check out instead. Anyways, here is the itinerary:

Day 1 (Nov 5):  
Arrive in Narita Airport at around 0630hrs and buy a Suica/Pasmo card. Take the train to our hostel (Hostel Bedgasm) and leave our stuff/freshen up.

* Meiji Shrine
* Shinjuku Gyoen National Garden
* Omoide Yokocho
* Shinjuku Golden-Gai
* Godzilla Head
* Kabukicho

\^Check out all of these things which are walking distance. Maybe go to Shibuya if we have free time because most of these are meant to be seen at night-time so after Meiji Shrine and the National Garden we might have 4-5h to kill.

After this - sleep

Day 2 (Nov 6):

* Ueno Park
* Tokyo Nationoal Museum
* Kanda Myoujin Shrine
* Yodobashi Akiba
* Akihabara Radio Kaikan
* Possibly Ninento Jump Shop
* Possibly go to the various Kapital chains to get some Japanese denim

Sleep

Day 3 (Nov 7):

* Imado Shrine
* Asakusa Shrine
* Sens≈ç-ji
* Kaminarimon
* SAMURAI NINJA MUSEUM Tokyo

Get some food either near our hostel or based on what we are craving we might check out various parts of Tokyo.

Go back to the hostel and sleep.

Day 4 (Nov 8):

* teamlab borderless
* Zojo-ji Temple
* Shimokitazawa
* Travis Scott concert at Belluna Dome

Sleep

Day 5 (Nov 9):

Get an express train early in the morning for Otsuki Station and take the train to Kawaguchiko.

* Chureito Pagoda
* Lake Kawaguchi - panoramic ropeway, aokigahara forest, rent a bike and ride around (not sure what to expect here but I just want to see the nature/terrain and enjoy the nature Japan has to offer)

This one is kind of an off/down day to rest, relax and hopefully catch a view of Mount Fuji.

Sleep at Dot Hostel&Bar

Day 6 (Nov 10):

Kawaguchiko Station to Otsuki Station > Get off and board again on the Chuo LIne until the Hachioji Station > Get off and board again on the Yokohama Line until Shin-Yokohama Station > Get off and board the Tokaido Shinkansen all the way to Kyoto (get on either Hikari or Nozomi branches based on ticket)

* Arashiyama Bamboo Forest 

Food and Sleep - not quite sure what kind of food Kyoto/Osaka is really famous for. 

Day 7 (Nov 11):

* Fushimi-Inari Taisha
* Itsukushima-jinja Shrine
* Kiyomizu-Dera (afraid not enough time for this but really want to do so it may be flexible ie. do it on other days when we have more free time)
* Nishiki Market

Sleep at Backpacker's Hostel K's House

Day 8 (Nov 12):

* Adashino Nenbutsuji Temple
* Otagi Nenbutsuji Temple
* Check out the various street food options maybe
* Check out possible Kyoto night life (would appreciate advice on this)

Day 9 (Nov 13):

Train to Osaka and leave our bags at hostel (First Cabin Nishi Umeda)

* Shitennoji
* Keitakuen Garden
* Osaka Museum of History
* Tenjinbashi Shopping Street

Sleep

Day 10 (Nov 14):

* Himeji Castle
* Mt Shosha
* Koko-en

Sleeo

Day 11 (Nov 15):

This one is the big confusing date since me and my friend initially wanted to check out Universal Studios Japan but the thought of waiting around for literally hours just for few rides did not appeal to us at all. So we were thinking of doing a day trip to Hiroshima and Miyujima Island but don't know if we will have enough time? Also thinking about maybe going to Nara Deer Park maybe and then spending some time in Dotonbori and in the streets of Osaka after we come back from Nara.

Day 12 (Nov 16):

Shinkansen from Osaka to Tokyo - try to catch a view of Mount Fuji :)

This is a down day where we just consolidate our bags and items while also maybe doing some souvenir shopping for friends and family. Maybe we will go to Mega Don Quijote? I also really wanted to go to a high rise bar at night and I will probably check it out when I am actually in Tokyo and go based on vibes instead of convincing myself that I need to decide on the high rise bar now.

Sleep in Hostel Bedgasm again.

Day 13 (Nov 17):

Fly back home :(

I really wanted to mix the Japanese city aesthetic/architecture with culture, arts and nature. I want to go to a lot of shrines and temples and stuff and will probably get the book on my first day whereby you can get the priest to stamp a page to acknowledge you were there on that day.

I would love to get any advice on this itinerary. Thank you!",https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1mvf3t7/itinerary_check_and_advice_for_november_trip_to/,"How long is your flight? ‚úàÔ∏è 
You might be too tired to do too much.
Can you freshen up at Bedgasm when you arrive early? Check up on that. Try to recover and not do too much so you are good to go the next day!

My advice is don‚Äôt go to USJ unless you are a theme park enthusiast. It is hours of waiting in big crowds, and you might not even get into the Nintendo part. Sometimes there is a waiting list.

If you go to Hiroshima spend 1 night. It‚Äôs a bit much to travel and do the Peace Park and Miyajima island.

Nara is a great idea. A lot to see there for a nice full day. Not far. Deer available. Cheaper than going to Hiroshima.

Perhaps consider staying at an Airbnb. The ones a little to the south in Osaka are cheap because this is the adult district and there are some homeless. Tho there is no danger. It might be nicer to have your own place rather than going from hostel to hostel where you typically sleep with many on the same floor. You‚Äôll be more rested. Can come and go as you please. 

This is something I don‚Äôt know but are SUICA and other IC cards still in short supply? I‚Äôd want to know myself ^^

Maybe check if it fits into your plan to go to Fushimi Inari on November 8. Hitaki-sai Fire Festival will start at 13:00 üïê","I think having 3-4 things planned for a day is great and pretty attainable, just keep in mind sometimes it might be best to pivot and do something else or don‚Äôt get discouraged if you don‚Äôt end up getting to make it to a specific thing. Over planning can stress you out and take a lot of the fun away from exploring and taking everything in while you‚Äôre there, but again I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôll have this issue.
I think you‚Äôve got a great mix of sight seeing, culture exploring, and ‚Äúself indulgent‚Äù tourist things! 
A ‚Äútip‚Äù/something I liked to do was wake up a little bit earlier each morning and just go out and explore the town of wherever I was staying. Not purposefully looking any places up, mostly just wondering, OR pull up your map app of choice and just see where the closest patch of green is in the city and see if you can find it, could be a park, temple, shrine!
Enjoy!!!","Quick tip for your Travis concert, if you are interested in buying merch you should show up early.¬†
For Billie Eilish the past weekend I only waited 30 mins but Red Hot Chili Peppers was about 3 hours.¬†

Both artists had a bunch of sold out merch by the time I got to the front and this is custom here, many people line up hours before the concert.","You can take a bus from Kawaguchiko station to Mishima and catch the Tokaido Shinkansen from there to Kyoto. Absolutely no need to go all the way back to Tokyo.

Also, check if you can forward your luggage to your hostel. We sent our bags from Tokyo to Kyoto for about $20US and went to Kawaguchiko with two days worth of clothes in a backpack with zero problems. There are coin lockers at the Chureito Pagoda station to leave your bag if you don‚Äôt want to hike up with it.",

Now I have free day between 10-11 Dec (departure 11 Dec 11:30 P.M). How can I fill these days? Any schedule/day trip or activities I can fit?

I‚Äôm open to removing some days from osaka/tokyo to add 3rd destination. Or if you feel I‚Äôm spending too long in a city or missing something let me know please.",https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1msl1v7/16_days_between_osaka_tokyo/,"I don‚Äôt really get why you are staying in Osaka when you aren‚Äôt actually spending any of your days in Osaka other than the day you are at Universal, but YMMV","It looks good! But for more accurate suggestions, a question:  
First trip to japan? Or have you gone before?  
Also, you wrote kinkaku-ji on 27 and golden pavilion on 29, but those are the same shrine.","If you want to spend 2 days and a night in Kyoto you'd be best off staying there - the commute from Osaka is about an hour in each direction, so this saves you a useful amount of time.

It seems a shame to only see the unpleasant deer and one site in Nara - there's a lot of other great things to see there. The Umeda Sky Building is pretty underwhelming unless you have an interest in Osaka's geography, so I'd suggest skipping it to allow you to spend the full day in Nara.","Why are you staying in Osaka when you're spending way more time in Kyoto? Seems like a waste of time and money to add a daily hour long commute instead of staying in Kyoto.


I would spend some extra time in Kyoto in the evenings to check out the temple illuminations.


Kinkakuji and Fushimi Inari are on opposite sides of Kyoto and Kinakuji is the same thing as the Golden Pavilion so you have it listed twice. Its closer to Arashiyama so makes more sense to do it on that day.


Do Miyajima and Hiroshima on two separate days. Miyajima is really beautiful in fall. Try to schedule Miyajima for a clear day if you want the view from Mt Misen.


I don't know why Kappabashi warrants a whole day unless you're a really dedicated kitchen shopper or how you plan to do Shinjuku Gyoen at night when it closes at 6:30. Its also beautiful in fall, and its massive.


You're going at peak fall season but there's not many fall specific sites in your itinerary so I'd look into adding some of those. Minoo Park at Osaka, Koshikawa Korakuen or Mt Takao at Tokyo, Nanzenji Eikando at Kyoto are all great options. Many more if you search online.",

Does this pacing look realistic? Anything you‚Äôd recommend cutting, adding, or shifting?  
Thanks in advance!",https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1ms065s/15day_japan_itinerary_sept_oct_osaka_in_tokyo_out/,"I feel like your Osaka bit is going to not happen; walking around Dotonbori and then train-hopping to Shinsekai to do the same is a lot on your first night, especially if you're landing in Osaka any later than noon. Your first full day is usually jet lagged so hard that you should consider it a ""dead day."" Not a day for tripping out to Nara. And then seeing nothing else Osaka has to offer but instead going to Himeji and then Kyoto right away?

I'm sure you can still do most of the typical sights but route it better, and you might be attempting to cram every youtuber's Top Ten Things To Do In Kyoto in a fairly short stretch. Choose the things you, personally, absolutely want to see in person and be prepared to hack out all the less-important things when you're too tired or didn't time the trains right.","Have only been to Nikko as a day trip, but can recommend! I'll be visiting Enoshima later this year, but my guess is Nikko > Enoshima. The shrines and pagode were impressive, the walk next to the small river and the line of Jizo statues was nice and calming. Hakone I believe part of the fun is staying in Ryokan ('homestay' /B&B), maybe not as ideal for daytrip?


For train passes vs tickets, Japan Guide has a good calculator for seeing if the pass is worth it. With the recent price hikes it seems it has lost most it's USP https://www.japan-guide.com/railpass/",,,

is doing the trip in reversed is problematic, i saw some old posts that say that is it ok.

Kiso Valley Route:

Day 1: Torii Pass   
Arrive at Narai (4 hours by transport). Hike from Narai to Yabuhara and take a train to Nojiri. (6 km).

thanks!",https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1mruu93/kiso_valley_reversed/,"I‚Äôve only done the Magome to Tsumago portion, as many do, and it was mostly downhill if I remember correctly.

Magome to Nakastugawa would be going downhill again, but it‚Äôs a busy road.","For the tori pass, I would start at Yahabara. There is not much to see in that town, it mostly just a path to the trail head. That gives you plenty of day light time to make it through the forest part.

1n3s8i1,Day trip to Kamakura,"Hi! So I am going to Tokyo for a short 3-day trip in September and I am currently planning a day trip to Kamakura as I've haven't had the chance to go before. Would greatly appreciate some feedback/advice on whether my plan is realistic and/or whether I've missed out on anything that is more worthwhile to see than what I've listed below. 

One specific concern that I have is that I'm not sure if time is too tight and I've tried to fit too much in one day. For context, I'm solo female traveller in her late 20s.

Itinerary:

>\- 7:30AM: Depart from hotel in Ginza and travel to Kamakura Station;

>\- \~8:50AM: Take bus from Kamakura Station to Houkokuji;

>\- \~9:10AM: Explore **Houkokuji** and enjoy the matcha at the teahouse;

>\- 10AM: Take bus back to Kamakura Station;

>\- 10:15-12:15PM: Stroll around **Komachi-dori,** get some street food, chill at a cafe for coffee or dessert;

>\- 12:15PM: Walk from Kamakura Station area to Zeniarai Benten Shrine while making a few pit-stops at nearby pottery stores;

>\- 1PM: Visit the **Zeniarai Benten Shrine**;¬†

>\- 1:30PM: Walk back to Kamakura Station and take Enoden to Hase Station;

>\- \~2PM: Have lunch around Hase area;

>\- 3PM: Visit the **Kotoku-in**;¬†

>\- 3:30-5PM: Visit the **Hase-dera;**¬†

>\- 5PM: Take a short break for a drink at nearby coffee shop or cafe;

>\- \~5:30PM: Take Enoden from Hase Station to Kamakurakoko-Mae Station and walk along the coast/**Shichirigahama Beach** while sun sets;

>\- 6:20PM: Take Enoden from Shichirigahama Station to dinner location;

>\- 6:30-7:30PM: Have dinner and head back to Kamakura Station; and

>\- 7:45-9PM: Travel back to hotel in Ginza and rest.",https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1n3s8i1/day_trip_to_kamakura/,"When visiting Kamakura, I always recommend that people get off at Kita-Kamakura station, look at one or two of the temples near the station (such as Engaku-ji and Meigetsu-in), and then follow the Daibutsu walking trail down through the woods, past Zeni-arai Benten shrine, to the Daibutsu (Big Buddha). From there, you can then walk or catch a bus into central Kamakura.

Info on Kamakura walking trails:¬†https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e3113.html

Info on what to see and do in Kamakura:¬†https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2166.html

Outside the west exit of Kamakura station, next to the old clock tower, is a nice little dessert place called ""Kamakura Chacha"" that sells tea and icecream, including maccha and hojicha soft cream (soft serve ice cream). It's a nice place to stop for a break if you've walked from Kita-Kamakura and seen the Daibutsu and then walked to central Kamakura. https://maps.app.goo.gl/BoEbYbid9wWhFjQ58

Still on the west side of Kamakura station, down a narrow side street off Onari-dori, is an okonomiyaki place called ""Tsukui"", run by two elderly men. There is a nice little walled garden behind the restaurant and you can get a table next to the windows looking out onto the garden. Each table has a hot plate and you cook your own okonomiyaki (or yakisoba, or chahan (fried rice) or some other dishes). It's a really lovely restaurant and we try to go there whenever we visit Kamakura: https://maps.app.goo.gl/y6RpHipR9ZHgDcbE7

If you visit Kamakura, a traditional meibutsu (regional specialty) that is often given as a gift is hato sabure, pigeon-shaped sable biscuits. There are various gift shops around the station that sell packaged hato sabure but a lovely place to buy freshly-baked biscuits is Toshimaya Honten, a Japanese confectionary store on Wakamiya-oji, a cherry-tree lined street that runs parallel to the popular (and very crowded) Komachi-dori shopping street: https://maps.app.goo.gl/osExVK32vjdNn7xLA","That‚Äôs a packed schedule but definitely doable if you‚Äôre an early riser. The only thing I‚Äôd say is maybe don‚Äôt stress about Houkokuji + tea if you‚Äôre short on time, since Komachi-dori and the temples can easily eat up more hours than planned. Sunset at Shichirigahama Beach is a great call though","If you are going to Kamakura, have you considered visiting Enoshima as well? It‚Äôs a really nice spot and definitely worth the visit!","Take the train from Shinjuku early in the AM and get off at Kitakamakura St.. then visit the temples going downhill towards the town. Be prepared for crowds in the town of Kamakura, it‚Äôs gotten overtouristed.",

As for the destinations - well, pretty standard, but that's fine, it's popular for a reason. But I do wonder why you didn't bother staying in Kyoto instead. Osaka is fun for 2 days, tops?

**Day 1 (Arrival)**

* Check-in ‚Üí Evening in¬†**Shibuya**: Shibuya Crossing, Hachiko statue, dinner (ramen/izakaya).

**Day 2 ‚Äì Shibuya/Harajuku Cluster**

* Morning: Meiji Shrine (peaceful before crowds).

* Afternoon: Yoyogi Park.
* Evening: Back to Shibuya (explore + casual dinner).

**Day 3 ‚Äì Asakusa/Ueno**

* Morning: Senso-ji Temple + Nakamise-dori (street snacks + charms).
* Afternoon: Ueno Park ‚Üí Tokyo National Museum.
* Late Afternoon: Yanaka for retro streets + sweets.
* Dinner: Izakaya in Kanda or Akabane (local vibe).

**Day 4 ‚Äì Central Tokyo (Ginza/Tsukiji/Imperial Palace)**

I spent a whole day over there last year going to the zoo, the park and the museum and ran out of time. I didn't see very much of the museum before it closed.","I would recommend seeing Yanaka Ginza in the morning when the food made by the shops is as fresh as possible. It's a nice spot, and I try to go every time I'm in Tokyo. Also, I think most shops close pretty early, around 5 p.m. in Yanaka.

On the same day, I think you should have dinner in Ueno at Ameyoko instead of Kanda or Akbane; it's a vibe on that street.

I haven't been, but if Tokyo National Museum isn't on your must-do list, then I think you should skip it. If you do, change your Day 3 to be Asakusa -> Yanaka Ginza + other parts of Nippori (if you don't spend too long at Yanaka) -> Ueno","Shimokitazawa has lots of 'curated' 'vintage' clothing shops that are expensive. Most of the shops do not open until 11 AM or noon. Coffee shops also tend to not open until 10 or 11 AM. Similarly, count on shops at Nakamise opening at about 10 AM.

I'll take a stab at guessing here: you'll be able to do three things each day.","I think location wise it looks pretty doable, just to note that your plan includes a lot of walking (easily 20000+ a day if you plan to tour thoroughly at each spot) so remember to bring comfy shoes!",

Hey r/JapanTravel!

The wife and I are taking a long-awaited anniversary trip to Japan now in September. We're first-timers to the country, and so we're mostly sticking to the usual Golden Route destinations (with a stopover in an onsen in the Gunma mountains), but we'd also want to mix in some off-the-beaten-path options. I'm not really sure if this itinerary makes sense, so I'd really appreciate any comments, feedback, and suggestions. If you have any recommendations for restaurants (especially gluten-free ones), bars, or other activities along this itinerary, those would also be fantastic!

The hotels are already booked, so the main cities and dates are locked in, but I'm looking for feedback on the day-by-day activities and day-trips.

## Questions

- **Nara day trip:** We can't decide whether to do Nara from Osaka (as planned) or to move it to our Kyoto stay. I figured that there's more to see in Kyoto, so it's best to spend one of our Osaka days on it. What makes the most sense?
- **Day trip from Tokyo on Sept. 18th:** If the skies are clear, is Kawaguchiko worth it (vs. staying in Tokyo)? If cloudy, would you pick Kamakura/Enoshima, Nikko, or Yokohama (or something else)? Or is there too much left to see in Tokyo to bother with a day trip?
- **Den-Den and Shinsekai on Sept. 7th:** Is a stroll from Shinsaibashi to Shinsekai (through Den-Den) enough activity for a full day, or should we try to add something else to round out the day? I'm thinking Umeda, Abeno Harukas, Sumiyoshi Taisha, etc.
- **Himeji + Kobe in one day:** Is this pacing reasonable? How much time should we budget for Himeji Castle?
- **Akasaka Hikawa Festival (Friday Sept. 19th):** Does anyone have experience with this festival? It doesn't seem to be super popular with tourists, but it's the only one happening during our visit. Is it worth seeing?
- Any other feedback, recommendations, or tips are also very appreciated!

Thanks a lot for taking the time to read and respond!",https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1myxp6n/firsttime_2week_trip_itinerary_looking_for/,"Sept 7:

Be aware that Den Den Town isnt really open in the morning. Most store stores are not open till 11AM or noon.

Sept 9/10:

Consider linking your Nara trip to be between Osaka and Kyoto - though if you already booked hotels and don't want to change them, it may not benefit you. You can get more time in Osaka or Kyoto rather than time commuting if you do.

Forward luggage if you want to travel light. Checkout in Osaka. Catch train to Nara. Store any bags in coin lockers at Nara Station. Do your Nara Day activities. Catch the train to Kyoto. Checkin to hotel in Kyoto.","I think having the Nara day trip in your Osaka leg makes sense. I agree with your assumption about there being more to do in Kyoto than Osaka.

Kyoto has a nice new Nintendo store that might be of interest. I imagine you guys like games or anime if you're going to Akihabara. There is also the Kyoto International Manga Museum if you need an indoor activity. 

I found Shinsekai to be somewhat unimpressive. Maybe adding Umeda Sky would be a good idea.","Agree on Nara trip from Osaka

Day trip - well, yeah. if it's clear I'd go to see Fuji. For Kamakura - seems like in Kyoto there will be enough shrines for you. Nikko is nice if you fan of nature and waterfalls in particular, but the ride might be a bit tiring for a day trip. If you're into skyscrepers, neon light - Yokogama is a nice choice and easy ride

For Osaka - I'd leave Den-Den and Shinsekai for the evening. I didn't see Osaka castle - you can start from there, even though the castle is not that interesting, the park is nice and there is a rooftop bar BLUE BIRDS where you can have coffee or smth (skip the food). Also there is nice  viewpoint WowUs over the downtown (and it's free!)

For Himeji and Kobe - all is good. I'd say you'd need a couple of hours for the castle and garden. Keep in mind you'd neeed to take off your shoes, so might consider taking some socks with you

For the festival (tbh doesn't look that interesting), but anyway I'd suggest to skip SkyTree and after Asakusa go to Tokyo Tower (especially if you don't go to Shibuya Sky) - the view seems to be more interesting. TeamLabs Borderless not interested? And then you can walk all the way to Akasaka and decide if you like the festival or not",Maybe you would disagree but I don't see why you need to stay in Osaka at all. You basically have a day and a half in Osaka. Why not take the Haruka Express directly from KIX to Kyoto and just do the 30 min train ride from Kyoto to Osaka when you want to visit?,Just a little tip about Himeji. There is a office building called Himeji Egret on the approach to the castle. It is a 5 story building with a free observation deck on top. It has great unobstructed views of the castle.

Thanks!",https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1mvt42v/23_day_autumn_japan_solo_itinerary_advice_and/,Sounds pretty awesome to me; enjoy!,"Your timing looks really well aligned based on last year's foliage!


I would suggest leaving some flexibility in your itinerary so when you're in Japan you can look up the live foliage news and go to the spots that are in peak color, this worked very well for me last year as a lot of ""famous spots"" were still very green but the lesser known spots I went to were still breathtaking and much less crowded.


My biggest advice: do NOT do Naoshima as a day trip the way you have it set up here. First of all its a really long way from Hiroshima and Osaka (3 hours), so that's 6 hours of your day in transit wasted. On top of that the ferries run on a fixed schedule which means you're going to be worried about missing it. Then there's the attractions which are spread out all over the island, the best way is to enjoy them on foot, or on bike, taking a bus between either side, which is also not frequent. Its a laidback island and immersive art experience thats best enjoyed slow. If you rock up, see a museum or two and then leave, I expect it will be quite underwhelming, a long journey for little pay off. My suggestion would be to cut a day from Tokyo and spend the night on the island if you want to see it. Maybe do Miyajima on your first day, half day for Peace Park and Atomic Dome, other half to transfew to Naoshima, and then 2 nights on the island, should give you 1.5 days to explore the island.


For foliage in Tokyo, Shinjuku Gyoen was really beautiful as was Koshikawa Korakuen. If you go to the top of the nearby Bunkyo Civic Center (its free) you get a birds eye view of the gardens in color. Mt Takao is also a great half day fall day trip from Tokyo. Minoo Park in Osaka is a also a good half day option. Remember that some temples in Kyoto are open at night and have special illustrations in fall.",Kiyomizu during peak foliage season on Sunday afternoon? I am not sure it is a good idea.,"My only amendment would be to spend a night on Naoshima so you‚Äôll be less rushed/worried about missing the ferry. It‚Äôs a long trip that feels longer in real life. 

Have fun!","Honestly it's not bad the good thing of a solo trip is that you can change your schedule on the fly. I mean Shinjuku Shibuya and Ginza all in one day seems crazy but you'll soon find out how big they are and how far apart they are and may not make it to all.

But enjoy."
1mujfz5,15 days trip in february,"Hi there !

We are going from the 19th February to the 7th march 2026 with my wife and my 10 years old boy. This is our first real trip together and in Japan. I'm a tibetan translator so I'm quite fond of Buddhism and quiet spaces but I did grew up in the anime culture and have nothing against busy cities. My wife is a city bee, she's a movie director, gaming and kawai stuff. My child loves wildlife, reading and gaming (Zelda, mario...) I don't want us to be in a rush, my wife works really a lot and I want this to be a bit chill and not have to move around with luggage all the time.

 Here is a rough sketch of our itinerary, I didn't put what we'll do in each area as I guess we'll find plenty to do but in case you have special recommendations I'm all ears !

Do you think the order is right or is there any big issues ?

1msq0j1,2 week Japan itinerary help - Okinawa: Yes/No?,"Edit: thanks all for your advice, it‚Äôs made things so much more clearer so we‚Äôre gonna leave Okinawa this time and come back to do the island properly when we can dedicate island hopping time to it. 

Although now we‚Äôre stuck on whether to do a night in Mt Fuji so we can wake up in the morning and have a better chance of visibility! Could do a day trip but I know some of the popular spots like the pagoda viewpoint will be super busy and also less chance of visibility. 

Maybe thinking of doing a trip to Kamakura for sunset and then go to Fujimawaguchiko to stay the night for an early morning stroll around the area. But I know mid Sep isn‚Äôt the best and it‚Äôs hard to plan in  advance for this as it has a knock on effect on how long we‚Äôd book our stay in Tokyo for. 


Original post (for anyone else who looks for same advice in future):-

Me and my girlfriend are going Japan for the first time soon for 2 weeks - September 19th - October 4th. We have a rough itinerary doing the main places most people do - Tokyo, Mt Fuji, Kyoto, and Osaka.¬†  
  
When we set out to book Japan we did so with the intention of going Okinawa (Or the Okinawan islands) and had set out about 4-5 days for this, but realised now how much there is to do between the other destinations I mentioned that we don‚Äôt know if we should sacrifice some of it to make time for Okinawa - either keep the 2 days we have currently planned below, sacrifice it, or sacrifice other days to make more time for it. Can anyone who‚Äôs been to Okinawa, or lives in Japan be able to give their thoughts?¬†  
  
Our rough itinerary atm is this:  
  
**Tokyo**¬†  (Not an exhaustive list of things to see/do)
*Days 1-4
 Explore; Shinjuku, Shibuya, Roppongi; Golden Gai; Senso-Ji temple; Yamaha;Nezu; Shibuya Sky; Tokyo Car Club by night;Imperial Palace Gardens; TeamLabs; Evening train to Mt Fuji  
  
**Mt Fuji / Lake Kawaguchiko**  (potentially cancel due to low visibility?)
*Day 5:* Explore area around Mt Fuji/ Lake Kawaguchiko; Evening travel to Kyoto  
  
**Kyoto** (we haven‚Äôt set a full itinerary but just have a list of stuff we could do)  
*Day 6/7/8/9:* Bamboo forest; explore Kifune; Golden Pavillion; Gion (Hokan-Ji 5 storey pagoda, Tea ceremony in a traditional tea house, Geisha performance); Kiyomizudera Temple;¬†Higashiyama disitrict; Fushimi ward; Fushimi Inari Tori Gates; Tenjuan Temple; Daigo-ji Temple; Byodo-in temple; Yasakaa Shrin and Maruyama Park; Sagano romantic train and Hozugawa River Cruise

**Osaka**  
*Day 10:* Osaka Castle & Park / Dotonbori river cruise and walk, Nagazaki district, pub crawl  
*Day 11:* Universal Studios

**Okinawa**  
*Day 12:* Fly from Osaka AM; Explore, walk around; Dinner; sunset  
*Day 13:* Beach day, swim, snorkle etc

**Tokyo**  
Day 14: Early flight back to Tokyo / Or train back from Osaka  
Day 15: Half-day in Tokyo; Evening flight back to UK

Should we cut 1-3 days off somewhere else to go Okinawa? 

On one hand Okinawa looks amazing, and it would be a nice relaxing time between all the chaos and walking of the cities. When I‚Äôve been looking into Okinawa main island it seems to be sightseeing spots and cultural stuff which i think we‚Äôll have enough of in mainland. Ideally we just want really pristine beautiful beaches with clear water, sea life and some kayaking, but to be chilled and not have to travel about loads. The mangrove kayaking in spots looks cool too as does the stargazing.¬†

Anyone who's been to Okinawa recommend some of the islands if we go? The beaches on the main island don't look as amazing as some of the neighbouring islands.

Travel time between Tokyo, Kyoto, and Osaka will take more time than you really think and there's still a million things I wanted to do that I didn't get to. I personally think it's better to limit yourself a bit more to give more room for spontaneity and use Okinawa as an excuse to come back!","I would not go Okinawa if I were you, you‚Äôll just be wasting a lot of time traveling to and from airports just to be there for 2 days.

The food is superb, the scenery is different and while the public transportation is very annoyed I am still happy with Okinawa's charm. I would not stay for that long in Kyoto and go to Okinawa instead. For a first time visitor maybe Okinawa is shippable. With the traveling time to Okinawa I would say 3 nights there is a good benchmark.",
1mrbciz,"Planning a 2.5-Week Japan Trip: Osaka, Kyoto, Tokyo ‚Äì Looking for Feedback on Itinerary & Budget (Long Post)","Hey everyone!  
I‚Äôm heading to Japan this April for about two and a half weeks, splitting my time between Osaka, Kyoto, and Tokyo, with a few side trips in between. I tried to keep things balanced while still making it doable, though I know the pace is going to be pretty quick. For context, I‚Äôm used to walking 15 to 20k+ steps a day.

We‚Äôre a group of four (two couples), and our travel to and from Japan will take about 27 hours on average each way. I‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts on our itinerary and the free days I left open. Any recommendations, whether it‚Äôs restaurants, activities, or even full-day swaps, are more than welcome.

Also, I‚Äôd like your opinion on Day 04. I found two tours that look really interesting, but I‚Äôm not sure which one would be better.

I know I‚Äôm probably overplanned, but I‚Äôd rather have everything ready for this once in a lifetime trip than lose time deciding on the day or end up zigzagging around.

We‚Äôre also planning to bring around 1,000,000 yen per couple, but hotels, plane tickets, Shinkansen, and any advance-entry tickets will already be prepaid. Do you guys think this will be enough to cover food, tickets, and extras during the trip? I'm perfectly fine if I come back with a lot of it.

Once again, I really appreciate all the help, and I know its a long post.",https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1mrbciz/planning_a_25week_japan_trip_osaka_kyoto_tokyo/,"Tell your wife to visit a farm, not animal abuse center.","1 million yen per couple seems like quite a lot if you're excluding all the most expensive costs (travel, hotels, prebooked stuff).

1mq67b4,21-days through the Alps + Kyoto and Tokyo,"I'm planning this itinerary and would like some feedback, I would appreciate it!

The first time I visited Japan I went with my family along the golden route and we ended up visiting a lot of things in a hurry, this time I'll be going alone, in March and at a slower pace, I'm not the type of person who sets a route to follow, but I like to define the days in regions, mark some points of interest and discover others.

I confess that I'm a little apprehensive about the train tickets because the first time I went with the JR Pass and it was very practical and easy, but from the calculations I made, the 21-day JR Pass is much more expensive than what I would spend, the 14-day one wouldn't suit me and would also be more expensive (I would have to buy individual tickets anyway) so tickets would have to be purchased separately and some of them are not available through the SmartEx app.

**Day 1:** Arrive in Narita at 3 p.m., take the train to Nagoya (Narita > Shinagawa > Nagoya), arriving between 7 and 9 p.m. I'll check in and look for some kaitenzushi for dinner.

**Day 2:** Stroll around the Fushimi area, Nagoya Castle (and the renovated internal areas) and Kinsachi Yokocho, Osu Kannon Temple and Osu Shotengai.

**Day 3:** Day trip to Gujo-Hachiman. This is the route I'm most concerned about. I'll go from Nagoya to Mino-ota and from there take a train to Gujo (the beautiful Nagaragawa railway). There are not many options leaving from Mino-ota and the trains I managed to check would be 30 minutes apart, but I think it's doable. I know you can also go by bus, but I prefer the train experience. So if anyone has done this route, could you tell me how it was?

**Day 4:** Full day in Nagoya, visit Atsuta Jingu, Tokugawa Museum and Shikemichi.

**Day 5:** Day trip to Narai-Juku, the route has more options so I'm relaxed about this one.

**Day 6: Nagoya > Takayama:** nothing planned that day, just getting settled into the hotel and walking around the city and I'm still looking for a sake-related tour for next days in Takayama.

**Day 7:** Wake up early and visit the Miyagawa Morning Market, and stroll around the city, maybe the sake tour.

**Day 8:** Visit Hida Folk Village, Sanmachi district and Sakurayama Hachimangu Shrine.

**Day 9: Takayama > Gero Onsen:** Check in at the ryokan and start enjoying the onsens, these will be days to relax and take a break from the rush.

**Day 10:** To continue enjoying the hot springs, I think I'll have to leave the ryokan to find some lunch, maybe walk around the city and buy train tickets, return to the ryokan and enjoy the view of the mountains inside an onsen while I wait for my dinner.

**Day 11: Gero Onsen > Matsumoto:** Gero>Nagoya>Matsumoto, I know you can go back to Takayma and take a bus from there, but again, I prefer the shinkansen and the time is almost the same, my hotel check-in is at 2pm so I'll arrive around that time and stroll around the city, probably see Matsumoto Castle at sunset.

**Day 12:** Wake up early and go visit the Daio Wasabi Farm, return before lunch to Matsumoto and look for something to eat and visit a local brewery.

**Day 13: Matsumoto > Kyoto:** Last time I stayed in Kyoto for 6 days but I ended up doing everything in a rush. This time I want to take it more slowly. I'll probably check in, look for something to eat, and walk around. I still don't know if I'll do a day trip, maybe Osaka (I haven't visited yet), but it will depend on how I'm feeling.

**Day 14:** Visit the southern region of Kyoto, finally see Fushimi Inari calmly (the guide on the last visit only took us to the entrance of the toriis to take photos) and participate in some sake-related tour. I read that the region has some of the best and oldest distilleries in the city.

**Day 15:** If I don't do any day trips, I plan to visit the Higashiyama area, Nishiki Market and Chion-in Temple.

**Day 16:** Visit the northern part of the city and the Ryoan-ji, Myoshin-ji and Ninna-ji temples.

**Day 17: Kyoto > Tokyo:** I'll be staying in the Roppongi area, Tokyo Tower, Roppongi Hills etc, so I plan to do something there that day, I don't intend to do any day trips so I can be rested when I return home. I spent a lot of time in the Shinjuku and Shibuya last time, so I don't really have any intention of going there this time.

**Day 18:** Visit the Ebisu and Meguro regions and the National Beer Museum.

**Day 19:** Tours of the Harajuku area, such as Meiji Jingu and the Nezu Museum.

**Day 20:** Free day, nothing planned at first, maybe some shopping.

**Day 21:** Wake up slowly and get ready to catch my flight at 6pm.

**To make a few things clear:**

\- I like historical museums more than contemporary ones (TeamLab was a cool experience but I wouldn't go back).

\- I love Japanese cuisine, from Yoshinoya to fancy restaurants and I'll try everything (hello Nagoya-meshi and Takayama's meat sushi) but I prefer sushi and especially kaitenzushi, nothing against omakases but I like to choose what I'm going to eat.

\- I also have preferences for experiences rather than buying things.",https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1mq67b4/21days_through_the_alps_kyoto_and_tokyo/,"The order of the cities as you currently have it has a lot of unnecessary backtracking, which means hours of extra travel time and money wasted. For example, Gero to Matsumoto via Nagoya, then Matsumoto to Kyoto means a lot of unnecessary backtracking to and from Nagoya.

The most efficient order of the cities would be the options below, which avoids repeating / backtracking a segment:

***Clockwise option:
Nagoya - Gero Onsen - Takayama - Matsumoto - Narai-juku - Kyoto (transfer at Nagoya).

***Counterclockwise option:
Nagoya - Narai-juku - Matsumoto - Takayama - Gero Onsen - Kyoto (transfer at Nagoya)

Each leg of the above are well-established, straightforward connections, either via multiple train options or frequent express buses.

Fyi, Matsumoto <->Takayama is a very well traveled reserved bus route that winds through valleys in the Japanese Alps (no train available). You can see the schedule which differs by season and reserve the bus online. You can certainly go back to Nagoya to transfer, but that would add hours of unnecessary travel and cost, because you would be going south out of the Alps and go back into it via another valley (Kiso Valley) to get up to Matsumoto (and none of these trains are Shinkansen). 

Instead of Narai-juku, consider the Magome-Tsumago 2-3 hour Nakasendo hike. If you want to stick with Narai-juku, you can do it as a half day trip from Matsumoto (about 55 min each way). I would very much recommend a night or two in Matsumoto. This was my favorite town among the Japanese Alps towns.","Smartex is only for the Tokaido Shinkansen.

[JR west](https://www.westjr.co.jp/global/en/ticket/overview/) has its own.

Alternatively, buy at station.",I recommend the Showakan museum in Takayama,"We loved Gero. I feel like it is an underrated gem. It was so relaxing and the town has just enough to explore if you want. My favorite things were: Unagi at Unasho restaurant after getting off the train, Gassho Village + soba in the onsite restaurant, walking the mountain path to Oreg Cafe, exploring the shops along Yunomachi & Yamanote sts along with Onsen-ji temple. Have a great trip!",
1mp52sa,Yokohama for 2 days...too much? too little? I really have no idea.,"I'm visiting Japan in October and I will have 2 full days at the end of my trip to do whatever I want as a solo traveler. I'd really like to visit Yokohama but I'm not sure if all the things I want to do there will be overwhelming, or maybe it won't take as much time as I think? Any guidance is much appreciated!

Here's my list:

Nippon Maru & Yokohama Port Museum

Sankeien Garden

Walk around and see the Western style historic houses in the area including Yokohama Yamate Seiyoukan, the English rose garden and the British House

Find gachapon at Cosmo World (or are there better places to find gachapon in Yokohama?)

Yokohama Bay Bridge & Skywalk

Chinatown

I'd also like to do a lot of shopping because I won't have much time for it the rest of the trip. I'd like to browse around the Red Brick Warehouse, Marine & Walk and Motomachi Shopping Street. Above all I want to find a bookstore to buy some Japanese picture books for my kids, there is surely a place to find picture books in the areas listed above?

So, resuming it next month but this time instead of Tokyo, I am arriving at FUK and travelling up North all the way to Osaka.

Objectives:

To experience that solo backpacker kind of trip after what has been a stressful year from a work perspective.

Enjoy local food without a doubt. In fact, I would rate this as my first priority. Have that Ramen in FUK, Okinomiyaki in Hiroshima, Takayoki in Osaka etc.

Arashiyama and Fushimi are far apart. I‚Äôd choose 1 and spend some more time there. Be comfortably on time for the cooking class.

Oh and isn‚Äôt it better to stop at Himeji after Hiroshima since that‚Äôs on the way? 

Definitely eat at a yatai food stall in Fukuoka for the experience üçú","17 September is totally impossible. Nanzoin and Dazaifu¬†are outside of Fukuoka, and each requires at least half a day given travel times. You'd struggle to do either if you arrive at 1 PM (after you clear immigration and arrive at your hotel it would be at least 3 PM) and definitely can't do both. Canal City is a faded mall that even Uniqlo has moved out of - what interests you here?

For 19 September, what interests you regarding the Fukuoka Castle Ruins and Ohori Park? There's not much left of the castle and it's only worth visiting if you have a pretty deep interest in military history (I do, and enjoyed it). Ohori Park is nice park, but has no obvious attractions for international visitors. As it's likely to be quite warm, do you really want to do the Momochi Seaside Park in the afternoon?

Fukuoka has lots of interesting temples and museums, I'd suggest visiting them instead.

Himeji Castle would be best visited while travelling from Hiroshima to the Kansai region.","If you‚Äôre at all interested in manga/anime, there‚Äôs a JJK art exhibition that‚Äôs ongoing at Fukuoka city museum till 28th September. Just thought I‚Äôd throw that in as a potential idea",,

Even if you are committed to get to Hiroshima early morning and do memorial museum pretty much as soon as they open, you need to budget at least 2 hours there, then you have to get to miyajima, the earliest you get there will likely be noon (if you're very efficient), assuming you want to get some lunch you have the rest of the afternoon there but there is quite a bit of hiking, if you have that kind of energy at the point, it is doable but the island is big. And then you have to make sure you get the ferry back and the train back to Kyoto, it's a pretty hectic day on its own, seeing how much you want to do on day 5 really question your ability to keep up with the amazing race.

Just don't bite off more than you can chew.

Uji is very small, about a 3-4 hour max stop typically.  If Nara took all day then you just have Uji the next day.  

Uji and Fushimi Inari also can be a combo day too.  Both are on the same train line.

Is day 4, the Tokyo National Museum?  That‚Äôs in Ueno which you have on day 21 and is clear across the city from the Ghibli museum.  You have Shibuya, Shinjuku on day 21 with Ueno.  Shibuya/Shinjuku are very close to the ghibli museum.

You can get tickets for the Shinkansen at the station.","Tsukiji‚Äôs not the same since they moved the actual market operations to Toyosu, all that‚Äôs left are expensive tourist traps. If you want to check out the Toyosu market, it‚Äôs not far from one end of the Yurikamome line that goes through Odaiba, but you need to be there SUPER early like before 5 am. 

Make sure you know the geographical location of everything you want to see in Tokyo. Some of your days are too scattered and you‚Äôll be wasting time travelling across the city.

When going to Odaiba don‚Äôt miss out on the Miraikan museum, the Telecom Center free observatort, the Fuji TV observatory and the retro area of DECKS. You might also want to hike to the Daiba Park to see the ruins of the old Edo Period defensive batteries the island is named after. There‚Äôs also river boats you can take to Asakusa. 

Go for lunch at Diver City, they have a soba noodle restaurant where you can get REAL wasabi! And even if its not your thing check out the Gundam Front store to see some amazing pieces done by expert fan modelers.","Hi!
Your itinerary looks really nice, makes me want to go back to Japan.
On the whole, it doesn't seem too packed. I would even maybe spend less time in Tokyo and enjoy japanese nature instead but that's a matter of taste. It‚Äôs a great city and you definitely won't get bored.¬†Day 21 seems like a bit much, maybe you could skip something. Personally, I wouldn't do more than one or two Tokyo neighborhoods on one single day. My personal favourites are Asakusa, Ueno and Odaiba.
Also a random advice to take or leave: In Arashiyama, I would skip the bamboo Grove (so packed that I didn't find it enjoyable) and go hiking or biking a bit outside the touristic center, the nature is very nice. We went in February but it must be incredible in the fall.
I was also a bit nervous about Shinkansen reservations but we could always get on the train we wanted without one. Only once, at the weekend, the trains were quite full but if you are a bit flexible on the time, it's no problem. There are a lot of options between the cities you picked so you wouldn't have to wait much before the next one anyway.
Hope this helps, have a lot of fun!",We just got back from Japan and don't underestimate how tired youll be from all the walking. Often we walked 20 km a day. Also himeji castle is incredible and way better than Osaka. It's a short trip south of Kobe.,

I'm not sure what time you're looking to go to Shibuya Sky after Meiji Jingu, but I'd recommend going to Shibuya Sky about an hour before sunset.

Added notes:  
Both of us are from Australia, so we're used to long travel times.  
BUT if we are being unreasonable about long travel and then jumping into activites let me know!",https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1n75mws/first_time_in_japan_3_week_itinerary_check_am_i/,"For day 16, the Fushimi inari is really exhausting, as is USJ. I would choose one of those, or do a shopping day like the rest of the plan. Doutanburi is always crowded so getting through it might take a little longer than you expect.","For the most part I don't think it's too much in a particular day but in aggregate it seems exhausting, not to mention it seems like you're changing hotels/locations quite often, I am not sure how much checking in and out, packing and getting early to stations waiting for trains will eat up your schedule (and energy).

Personally I'd you have to ask if you're cramming too much, you probably are.","I think that you‚Äôre going to be disappointed if you go to Shibuya to avoid crowds! All the main centres in Tokyo are usually crowded. You don‚Äôt need to move hotels in Tokyo.

This looks sensible, other than day 16 which is much too busy.","Keep in mind that Ghibli tickets are sold on the 10th of the month for the coming month.  You'll need to set yourself a reminder based on Tokyo time to be sure you're in the system and booking.  Also, try not to lock yourself into that specific day (or time) to provide flexibility around availability. 

The business of shipping your luggage around seems like it might be worth the hassle.  Pack a bit lighter, do laundry and shove your gear in train station lockers or drop it at luggage storage places.  I have appreciated the perspective from Kensho Quest on YouTube, you may want to check some of their videos.

You've got plenty of time - take a look at less visited temples or shrines in Kyoto and consider if they'd scratch the same itch, but with less traffic.  Also consider just how many you *really* will want to see by the 15th day!

A final note, look up the places you want to visit and note their opening hours.  Lots of temples, etc. are 9-5, which really narrows your window if you're trying to rack up numbers as opposed to ambling about.","Going immediately to Nagano will not work with jet lag, it will destroy you. I liked Nagano, Zenkoji is lovely and I'm envious of staying in that ryokan, but do not do this on day 2. Plan for your first full day on the ground to be your dead day, just chill in Tokyo and do Nagano elsewhere. Route on your way between Tokyo and your next big thing, maybe - don't drop it, if you really want to visit Zenkoji for any reason, but make it part of a route instead of back and forth from Tokyo.

And just take your luggage on the train with you, don't bother with same day luggage shipping to your first hotel."
1n6jcib,Itinerary Review - Tokyo (4 Days),"Hello! I will be in Japan this November for roughly 13 days. The first leg of our trip is in Tokyo, and I would like some advice on how I have organized the itinerary for the initial 3 days in Tokyo and then the final day in Tokyo before we fly out. I'll have some specific questions below, but this is our overall itiniterary so you get an idea of how we'll be moving around the country. I'm really only asking about the Tokyo days since I'm still working out the entire Kyoto Itinerary. Thanks in advance!

**GENERAL TRAVEL PLAN**

* Day 1: Arrive in Tokyo
* **Day 2-4: Tokyo**
* Day 5: Travel to Kyoto
* Day 6-9: Kyoto
* Day 10: Travel to Kinosaki, stay at Ryokan
* Day 11: Travel to Tokyo
* **Day 12: Tokyo**
* Day 13: Fly Out of Tokyo

**TOKYO ITINERARY** (we will be staying at a hotel in the Akasaka area during the first three days and then north of the Ueno area for the final day)

* **Day 2 (Meiji Jingu and Shibuya):** Coffee/Tea, Meiji Jingu Shrine (get there at 7am to 8am), Yoyogi Park, Brunch/Lunch, walk down Cat Street in Harajuku to Shibuya and check out Tower Records, Loft, Parco Building (Nintendo Store, Pokemon Center, Shounen Jump Store), and Shibuya Scramble Crossing, get dinner in the area.
* **Day 2 (Ueno):** Coffee/Tea, Check out Parfum Satori (opens at 11am so may be get breakfast before somewhere?) and then take train to Tokyo National Museum (we want to make sure this happens early on in our trip even though Ueno is closer to our final hotel location) and spend most of the day there, walk through Ueno Park afterwards then walk down to Aneyoko Shopping Street and get dinner in Okachimachi.
* **Day 3 (Shinjuku):** Shinjuku Gyoen National Garden before 12pm (coffee/tea/breakfast before or after), potential stationery stores and otome merch shopping (Shinjuku Hands, Otomate Store, Melonbooks, Kingdom Note), then at night/afternoon check out Omoide Yokocho (retro drinking district) and Shinjuku Golden Gai, get dinner in the area.
* **Day 12 (Senso-Ji and Tsukiji):** Tsukiji Outer Market in the morning for breakfast (get there around 8am to beat the crowds), Hamarikyu Gardens for birding, then take a train to Senso-Ji Temple and check them out and the gardens and Nakamise Shopping Street in the afternoon as the sun goes down OR go to the Tobichi store if I still want to and we are feeling a bit tired and don't want to beat the crowds for another temple OR do something else entirely this day? Hamarikyu seems worth it for birding potentially.

**QUESTIONS**

* Two of the stories I'd really love to visit at some point but are a little out of the way are [Parfum Satori](https://maps.app.goo.gl/af4WkpFeATjazKEn7) and the [Tobichi Store](https://maps.app.goo.gl/UVf9c3qfdgok4ovQ8), and I've put tentative places for them in my itinerary but am wondering if there are better times to slot them in? Any recommendations on that would be great.
* Do you have recs for good vegetarian food in the areas we are visiting (we can eat fish and seafood so are moreso pescatarian)?
* We got a recommendation from a friend for [Mino Sushi](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Qwjz8KY5vrSLS1Qq8) and [Ginza Cafe Hanon](https://maps.app.goo.gl/5QxoNNWTPQCdyinc7) and was wondering if there would be any way to fit those into the itinerary I have going?
* Are these four days two packed? Is there anything you would do differently?
* I would love recommendations for parks or birding locations in and around Tokyo that you would recommend over anything I have listed. We're trying to decide if doing Senso-Ji is really worth it or if we would prefer something a little bit more slower paced that last day.",https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1n6jcib/itinerary_review_tokyo_4_days/,"For your day 3, on the way back from Shinjuku Gyouen, stop by the nearby Seikaido, which I believe is the largest stationery and art supply store in Japan. My spouse is a professional artist and stationery enthusiast and shops only there or at Yodobashi outlets (but does browse at Hands and used to at the now uncomfortably crowded Ito-ya).

I might also recommend Meiji Jingu for (early morning) birding, too.","This is coming from someone still finishing up my own itinerary, so my opinion be less informed, but these seem like very reasonable days. Especially if you're willing to be flexible and skip specific stops that you don't end up having time for to make room for random finds you come across.

I wouldn't worry about thos restaurant recommendations from friends, since it sounds like they're just random places they stumbled on and liked. You'll stumble on plenty of great places that can fit a pescatarian diet, so I wouldn't go out of your way for any specific recommendation unless it's something special","Schedule seems reasonable, but you might need to make your Itinerary more efficient/tighter if you want to hit up the stores you've listed. 

You could do something like:  
**Day 2: Meiji Jingu/Shibuya**   
**Day 3: Tsukiji/Ueno**   
**Day 4: Shinjuku** 

**Day 12 Senso-Ji/etc.**

For **Ginza Cafe Hanon**(btw your link is for Ginza Ityoa) and **Tobichi Store**. you could consider going there on the Tsujiki/Ueno day, Assuming you're starting at Akasaka station, take the train to Higashi Ginza, go to Ginza Cafe Hanon, then walk down to Tsukiji proper, it's a chill downhill walk through some pretty cool neighborhoods that shouldn't be too tiring. after you had your fill of Tsukiji, take the train from Tsukiji to Jimbocho to check out Tobichi Store, then head up to Ueno(this part of the route is kinda awkward, consider a taxi if you don't feel like walking a bit to the more convinient train station)

**Parfum Satori** could be done on your Shinjuku day, it's not that far from Akasaka, go there first, then from Roppongi Station, take the train to Kokuritsu-Kyogijo Station, visit Shinjuku Gyoen National Garden, and when you're done, take the north exit, Otomate Store right near by.

**Mino Sushi** is the awkward one as it's not close to anywhere you've listed, perhaps go there on day 12 for dinner?

 Also if you're into Otome Games then why not check out Ikebukuro's Otome Street?","Why not just get dinner at Ameyoko? It's a total vibe there at night.

Also, for that day, you should check out Yanaka Ginza in Nippori. It's just two short stops over from Ueno. Go there in the morning to get fresh goods from local shops. Shops close at 5 p.m.

Your days look good though. Good to be flexible and not have a strict itinerary for every day.",
1n5aa1p,"20 Days in Kyushu next April, looking for some feedback","Hi, I am looking for some feedback on my upcoming 2nd trip to Japan. I've been doing planning and research for 3 weeks now, and this is my 5th version of the draft, you can see from the posts I've made what some of the previous version were.

I will be travelling from **April 7th to the 29th**.  Now unfortunately I will have to do course work (Accounting)  during my trip, my options were to either mix school and travel, or not going to Japan for quite a while,  so on my spreadsheet, I split each day into a free day or a study day, I've given myself 2 free days per week, to allow me to enjoy some days without the expectation of studying.

My plan with studying would be to wake up earlier, and do 1 hour revision, then get on with the rest of my day, start my day around 9-10am, then explore, eat lunch etc until, like 3-4pm, go back to my accommodation, shower and study for 2 hours, this also in a way acts like a forced break, and afterwards I would eat dinner, and maybe go sight see somewhere if I still wanted to go anywhere. I should also clarify this is not a university course.

Example: [https://imgur.com/a/GdxO0JZ](https://imgur.com/a/GdxO0JZ)

Lastly, before I get into it, I feel like I should mention, I am basing this trip on 4 locations:  
**Nagasaki, Yakushima, Takachiho Gorge, Kurokawa Onsen** (Used to be Miyajima, but I decided to drop Hiroshima), so for example on a day like April 16th, where I am going to Kumamoto, if I don't feel like walking or just need rest then I am just going to skip the castle, I just thought I should mention that.

With this trip I am trying to strike a balance between Nature/Food/City experiences, last time I was in Japan I didn't mind it, but it felt like I spent too much time in cities, and didn't really go outside to see the beautiful nature in Japan.

Itinerary:  
**April 8:** Arrive in KIX at 12:35pm, take the limousine bus to Hotarugaike station, I want to stay close to the Itami airport, plus since I will have a checked bag, I don't really want to use the train system, so a bus seems good, I will probably just grab a bite to eat and chill for the rest of the day.

**April 9:** Fly to Yakushima, arrival time should be around 1:10PM, I would've really wanted to fly on the 8th to save a day, however I learned that there's only 1 flight per day, and I can't make it, I think there's too much value to start in Yakushima, that even though I have to sacrifice one night, it's still worth it.  Upon arrival my goal is to just sort everything out, so pick up rental car, check in to my accommodation, I decided to stay in the Anbo area.

**April 10:** Yakusugi Land - I haven't decided yet, but I am thinking about either the 80 min hike, or the 150 min hike, then head back, and eat dinner in the evening.

**April 11:**  Senpiro Falls ->  Oko-no-taki falls -> Hirauchi Kaichu onsen if possible.

My main goal with this day, is to drive to the Oko-no-taki waterfall, and stop at anything interesting on the way to it.

**April 12:** Shiratani Unsuikyo Gorge, I am giving myself 6 hours for this hike in total, I would like to do the Taikoiwa course, so go as far as Drum Rock, and go back afterwards, again not planning anything afterwards, probably just take a shower and grab dinner.

**April 13:** Ferry to Kagoshima

Check out, give the car back as well. I would probably take the jetfoil ferry, to Kagoshima, depending on what time I arrive, I would like to go to the Meiji Restoration museum and Shiroyama Park at around sunset, however I could push something back if timing is an issue.

**April 14:** Kagoshima

Sengan-en, is the main place I would like to go to on this day, and then probably just walk around and explore Kagoshima.

**April 15:** Kagoshima

If the volcano is chill, then I would like to rent a bike and cycle around the volcano, if not I would probably explore a new area of Kagoshima that I haven't been to, maybe Kirishima?

Also, food that I want to try while in Kagoshima: Black Pork, and Unagi at Eel Mitsuru if possible

  
**April 16:** Bullet train to Kumamoto

Kumamoto castle and the Suizenji Jojuen.  I would be alright with skipping the castle if I am not feeling super energetic.  I would like to check out the International Bar Detour that's in Kumamoto while I am there.

**April 17:** Drive to Takachiho Gorge

Pick up a rental car, and then drive to the Takachiho Gorge, afterwards head to Amanoiwato shrine, stay overnight in Takachiho, might grab soba for dinner at TENAN.

**April 18:** Mt. Aso part 1

Drive from Takachiho and on the way to Daikanbo lookout, stop by the Kamishikimi Kumanoimasu shrine. I would probably grab lunch/dinner at Ê∫∂Â≤©Áü≥Á™Ø„Éî„ÉÉ„ÉÑ„Ç°ËΩç or Wadachi Pizza, stay overnight in Aso town.

**April 19:** Mt. Aso part 2 and drive to Kurokawa Onsen

If possible I think it would be fun to have the helicopter ride around Mt. Aso, afterwards I would hike the Kishimadake Trail, finally drive to Kurokawa Onsen, I would like to stay at Kurokawa Onsen Okunoyu, I might also check out the Shinmeikan Onsen.

**April 20:** Kurokawa Onsen

A day to relax, and onsen hop, I have some ideas for onsens that I might want to go to, such as: Yamabiko, Yamamizaki and maybe one more if I feel like I need more time to soak.

**April 21:** Drive to Fukuoka

Drive to Kokonue Yume suspension bridge, I would like to be there around 11 am

Drive around 1h30min to Fukuoka, I haven't looked into it, but I would like to give the car back around Hakata station if possible, check in, and try the Hakata style ramen at ShinShin Hataka DEITOS

If I have time, and if I don't feel dead, yet, I would like to walk around and explore the Fukuoka Gion district and see the Tochoji Temple.

**April 22:** Fukuoka

Uminonakamichi Seaside Park, I think it would be pretty nice to rent a bike and drive around.

I might go to Canal City, or maybe just do some exploring and shopping, honestly the main reason why I am excited about Fukuoka is I've saved so many coffee shops, bars, and caf√©s that I want to go to.

Maybe go to the Yatai food stalls in the Tenjin area, 

The CITADEL cocktail bar looks pretty cool as well.

There's honestly so many places (restaurants, caf√©s, bars) I would like to go that it might be better to just provide a picture:

**April 23:** Fukuoka

Nanzoin temple in the morning (9-10am)

In the afternoon hours I would like to go to the teamLab Forest Fukuoka, Fukuoka city museum and finally Fukuoka tower, once it's dark outside.

**April 24:** Fukuoka

Explore the Dazaifu area, go to the Dazaifu-tenmangu shrine, on the way back I might stop by the Life-Size Gundam statue near LaLa port.

**April 25:**  Train to Nagasaki

On the way to Nagasaki I would really like to stop by the Yutoku Inari shrine, then keep going to Nagasaki, check in, pick up my forwarded luggage from Fukuoka, I am thinking about staying at the Forza hotel in Nagasaki, since it seems like quite a good location.

**April 26:** Nagasaki

Atomic Bomb museum

Hypocenter Park

Nagasaki Peace park

In the evening, once it's darker, I would like to take the cable car to the Mt. Inasayama overlook.

  
**April 27:** Nagasaki

Morning walk to Sofuku-Ji, since it's quite close to the hotel, if I do end up staying there.

Dutch Slope

Glover Garden

Oura Cathedral

In the evening, I would like to go to the Chinatown, to see the place lit up.

While in Nagasaki, I would like to try Castella, Sasebo burger, Toruko rice, Kakuni Manju. Don't know how I feel about Champon.

**April 28:** Nagasaki

I was planning to maybe go to the Mt.Unzen area, or go to Shimabara town, but I feel like I want to wind down and just stay in Nagasaki for my last full day, I might revisit some areas that I liked, e.g. Dejima or maybe just pick a new area and explore it.  One of my favourite things during the last trip was just walking the streets in the city, I especially liked Ueno, so I might do something similar, just appreciating the difference in everything compared to where I am from.

**April 29:** Fly from Nagasaki to Osaka Itami, I was planning to maybe revisit a place I've been to during my last trip to Japan, but since it's the start of Golden Week, the thought of visiting something in Osaka during golden week, scares me a bit, so I would probably just take the limousine bus to KIX.

If you want to add it, you‚Äôd need to drop something else.
Looking at your Kyoto plan: Day 8 is very central and already dense with major highlights (Kiyomizu-dera, Chion-in, Gion). Day 9 is packed with Arashiyama and several temples. Day 10 is a bit more flexible, with Fushimi Inari, Kinkaku-ji, and the Botanical Gardens. If Kifune Shrine is a must for you, I would remove the Kyoto Botanical Gardens and instead use that half-day for Kibune. You‚Äôd still be able to do Fushimi Inari in the morning and Kinkaku-ji later that day if you start early.","What are you planning on doing at the hotel chinzanso? Because if you want to see the sea of clouds, thats reserved for people using the hotels facilities.","Fushimi Inari and Kinkaku-Ji are completely opposite sides of town. Perhaps do Kinkaku-Ji at the end of Arashiyama day (maybe instead of the train?). I don‚Äôt think you need too much time for it.

Then next day you can do Fushimi in morning, Eikando, garden and go to Kifune. I would skip the garden personally and do Kurama to Kifune path, it‚Äôs awesome.",
1n4a9et,11 day first time Japan trip,"
first time going to Japan , flights booked for January , originally planned for a Tokyo only and then extended the days to add Osaka + Kyoto 

We are departing from Osaka so using it as a base for second part of the trip . Is staying in Osaka best even though that means going and coming back from Kyoto ? Biggest question is what to do with day 6 , original plan was to stay in Tokyo but now thinking to travel already to Osaka . Both Tokyo and Osaka hotels are already booked but I can still cancel if needed to move things around !

Day 1 landing narita 15pm after 2 flights . Hotel ( shinjuku )  chilled evening in the area / golden gai / metropolitan building. 

Day 2 meji-jingu / gotonjuki temple ( don‚Äôt know where to fit this / shibuya crossing / Pok√©mon centre / Takeshita street 

Day 3 senso-ji / nakamise st / Tokyo sky tree / asakusa / roku 

Day 4 imperial palace / ginza / akihabara / Tokyo tower 

Day 5 Ueno Park / Tokyo national museum / team labs planets  

Day 6 - originally planned for Tokyo . Unsure if either moving some of the stuff here / new plans or moving day 7 here and travelling this day to Osaka to give more time for second leg of the trip  
maybe adding Nara on one of the days ?
 
Day 7 travel to Osaka . Staying in umeda area , visit area around Osaka station / umeda sky  / dotonburi + namba night 

Day 8 Osaka castle / tstutenkaku / shitenno ji / sumiyoshi taisha 

Day 9 universal Osaka 

Day 10 travel to kyoto . Fushimi inari taisha / ginkaku ji
Kiyomizu dera / higashiyama yard 

Day 11 travel to Kyoto . Nijo castle / kinkaku ji / arashiyama ?

The nerves have well and truly hit.,"My girlfriend wanted to rent a car and do a road trip because it's something she'd done with her family in Hokkaido a lot.

For me I was worried it would be super inconvenient, expensive and probably eat up a lot of time vs just travelling on the trains. Also worried that many sections of Japan may not be that scenic to drive.

That being said, I'm starting to warm up to the idea of renting a car just for Shikoku. Maybe fly into Matsuyama from Kyoto and then loop around and finish in Imabari. Bike the Shiminami Kaido to Onomichi. Take the train to Hiroshima and then again to Fukuoka. Rent a car again and explore around Kyshu.

I'd have about 3 weeks so most of the trip would probably be in Shikoku/Onomichi/Hiroshima.

Any thoughts on how interesting a potential road trip in Shikoku would be? I was thinking since everywhere is along the coast it would be a much more interesting drive. Also since it's not a heavily populated area maybe it would be a more unique experience for us vs visiting major cities.","Looking for some recommendations for some capsule/budget hostel options in Tokyo (preferably around roughly 30 minutes around Shibuya) that **have space for two large suitcases.** I have around 10 days I need to spend in Shibuya before a spot opens up for me at a more permanent apartment, and I'm looking for somewhere that can deal with not just one, but two bulky suitcases. (I do not need active access to both of them. Could probably shift stuff around that I don't need access to either for the duration of my stay (ie, put everything in hand luggage and do laundry) if need be.)  
Any recommendations?",Do you recommend any mobile payment options? I got a debit credit card and PayPal in my Google wallet. I read that QR codes are widely used in Asia to pay for stuff. Are these option available to non-citizen? I'm German if that matters.,"Has anyone taken the Aizu railway? I wanted to ask whether it is recommened to get Aizu Gurutto Card or simply pay by cash for a round-trip.

We will be taking the trains from Tobu Asakusa station to Ashinomaki Onsen station via the Tobu limited express first before getting on the Aizu Tetsudo train. Our return route should roughly be the same."
1n2qhnl,10 Day Tokyo/Kyoto Itinerary Check,"Hello! My husband and I are traveling to Japan for the first time in a couple of weeks and are so excited! I've read tons of other itineraries I just wanted to post mine for any obvious issues or advice. We will have 5 full days in Tokyo and 2.5-3 days in Kyoto. We are pretty nerdy but also love nature and culture. We are great travelers, love to be on the go and make the most of each day. I planned mainly for certain areas each day aside from some reservations to keep things fairly flexible, but I'm not sure if we're trying to do way too much or if this seems doable!

We don't yet have reservations for either of the TeamLab exhibits yet, trying to find the best place to put them if possible!

Also waiting to try to get a Shibuya Sky reservation for an evening time slot on hopefully either 09/16 or 09/19.

**I left a free day on day 6 (09/19) to push anything missed from our first days to.**

My Kyoto plans were the most challenging, as I was overwhelmed by the sheer number of temples and shrines, we love to walk / hike, so hoping to do a good amount of that. Those plans are very up in the air.

**09/14 - (Travel)** Land at Narita at 7:00pm, get to hotel (Akasaka) and have dinner

**09/15 - (Tokyo)** Tsukiji market and shopping in Ginza, 1:15 Pokemon Cafe reservation (score!), Akihabara for rest of day (potato, shopping, etc)

**09/16 - (Tokyo)** Sensoji Temple and Ueno Park right away in the morning - Tokyo Skytree, then to Sunshine City (is it worth it to do both Skytree and Sunshine?) - Shinjiku for the afternoon / evening (Gyoen National Garden, shopping, walking around)

**09/17 - (Tokyo)** Meiji Shrine and Yoyogi Park in the morning then Harajuku - 2:00 Ghibli Museum reservation then back to Shibuya for the evening

**09/18 - (Tokyo)** Tokyo DisneySea (been to Magic Kingdom in CA and FL)

**09/19 - (Tokyo)** Free day - see anything we missed or want to revisit! (will put one TeamLab on this day probably)

**09/20 - (Tokyo/Kyoto)** Check out of Hotel, maybe got to Tokyo Station for food / shopping, Take Shinkansen to Kyoto, check into Hotel, Nishiki Market for the evening

**09/21 - (Kyoto)** Fushimi Inari early as possible - Nijo Castle - Philosophers Path - Gion for dinner and evening

**09/22 - (Kyoto/Nara)** Arashiyama Bamboo Grove - Golden Pavillion - half day trip to Nara - back in the evening and to Pontocho District for dinner

**09/23 - (Kyoto/Tokyo)** Check out of Hotel might have some time to walk around some more, Take Shinkansen to Tokyo, Airport, 8:00 PM flight

Thanks in advance!",https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1n2qhnl/10_day_tokyokyoto_itinerary_check/,"I probably would not do Shibuya Sky, Sunshine City Observatory and Skytree. It‚Äôs just all high up from different angles.

There‚Äôs no evening at Nishiki.  Closed by 5 or 6.

Fushimi Inari and Nara make sense together.  Arashiyama, Golden and Nara are all so far from each other than this makes this day very long.  Nijo is closer and makes more sense.

Reality is that you don‚Äôt have enough Kyoto days.","Dont go to tsukiji market. Very expensive and you are bound to walk into a market setting by chance in Japan. 
Instead check out of your hotel and go straight to kyoto for Nishki. There is shopping there too. 


I found that osaka has better shopping than tokyo lol why arent you visiting all the shops there, perhaps your free day in tokyo :P

25 min train ride between kyoto and Osaka

Sunshine city has a more interesting  surroundings as Ikebukuro is a pleasant area instead of going outwards to Tokyo sky tree. I went to the sky tree for a particular store and it was a novel collection of shops but felt Ikebukuro was a vibe and more interesting / authentic day living in tokyo","If you want to go to Tsukiji, you may consider Toyosu instead. WIth that, you may visit TeamLab Planet next to it the same day. You are really over ambitious by packing so many places in your 5 days in Tokyo. You actually have more items in your itinerary than our 9 full days in Tokyo.","Great itinerary.

Was there for 19 days in August, back a week and did many of your choices.

Bamboo Grove is lovely, but you can also walk from there to the river and Togetsukyo bridge, which are worth a look.

Agree with the other comment about how far away Nara is from there, so best to have that a different day.

H≈çkan-ji and it's surrounding area is stunning, but also not a bad pairing with Nara.

Nishiki Market is in the Main shopping area, and is very long, very narrow, but also very cool. Lots of little food places.

I stayed up till 3am uk time to get Ghibli museum tickets and it was probably my favourite part of the whole trip. Otherwise the imperial palace gardens were a bit underwhelming. Ueno park had a little market festival with a great little food market, but not sure if that's still on.",

Depart 8:25 PM from Haneda",https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1n18fno/is_my_itinerary_too_ambitious/,"Looks fun and totally doable if you trim a couple edges.

Landing 15:30 at Narita then Shibuya at night is fine, just keep it light so you do not burn day 2. For Tokyo day 2, your flow already makes sense: Asakusa at sunrise, Ueno then Yanaka, Skytree for sunset. I would choose either Tokyo Bay night shots or a Senso-ji night stroll, not both.

Fuji day: mid-November is prime for color at Kawaguchiko and usually clear air. Do Kawaguchiko North Shore + Panoramic Ropeway + Chureito in one loop and skip Kamakura the same day. If the forecast looks weak, swap Fuji with day 2 or 4. Use [isfujivisible.com](http://isfujivisible.com) to scan the week and grab the day that looks clear. It saves you from guessing.

Day 4 Tokyo: Meiji Jingu, Yoyogi, Harajuku live near each other. Koishikawa Korakuen is lovely but out of the way from that cluster; consider doing it on the Ueno day or drop it if you are short on time.

Kyoto move: keep day 5 tight in Higashiyama. Eikan-do night light-up is fantastic in mid-November, so pair Kiyomizu -> Ninenzaka -> Gion -> Pontocho and call it. Nijo is a detour you can skip if legs are tired.

Day 6 Fushimi Inari at dawn, then pop to Osaka for castle or city views, not both Harukas and Umeda. Dotonbori at night is plenty.

Day 7 is heavy. Kinkaku-ji + Ryoan-ji + Arashiyama in one morning is a sprint. Pick either Arashiyama or the temple duo, then head back to Tokyo.

Day 8 Borderless is timed entry, book early and build around that rather than locking the Imperial Palace tour.

Tiny bonus: on the Tokyo -> Kyoto Shinkansen reserve seat E for a Fuji window if the sky is clear.","Hello, I will leave out Osaka so you can enjoy Kyoto at a more enjoyable pace.","I would stay close to Shinjuku Station instead of Asakusa your first 2 nights, and do Kawaguchiko on Day 2. It will make visiting Shibuya on arrival day way less taxing (you could start in Harajuku and then Shibuya), and you'll be closer to getting to Kawaguchiko the next day. Then you can do Kabukicho in the evening. 

Hit up Shinjuku Goyen the following morning, though I would skip it on this short of a trip. It's big and can be a time suck, the line to get in and then walking around. Don't think there will be fall leaves. Tokyo gets them during the first few days of December but double check the fall foliage forecast.

Next 2 nights staying near Ueno station will make your visit to Asakusa, Akihibara, and Imperial Palace easy as well as taking the shinkansen to Kyoto.

I would skip Osaka on that short of a trip. If you were staying 1 or 2 more days, it could have been doable.

Night 7 I would stay in Hamamatsucho for easy access to TeamLab, Ginza, and an easy trip to Haneda.

I really min maxed my first trip to Japan (21 days) with the help and guidance of a friend who had already been to Japan multiple times for long periods and who is also into min max frugal travel.

Traveling all around Tokyo can really take up a lot of time. If you can spare the money or re allocate your budget, it's worth it to pay a little more and stay at hostel/capsule hotels, budget hotels that are close to stations. More accommodations often open up leading up to the trip so keeping an eye on them and switching if it's more convenient if you keep your reservations with good cancellation periods.

Expect a lot of conbini breakfast and sometimes conbini lunch. Don't bother waiting any more than 30 minutes to get into a restaurant or go out of your way for a specific one (that was my biggest regret on my first trip). There is so much good food all over Japan. Also, don't be afraid of high 3 star rating restaurants on Google. Ones frequented by locals will have lower stars cause Japanese folks tend to be very conservative when rating things.

Stay mindful of your energy too. Towards the end of my trip, I would lie down for nap and then accidentally sleep until the following morning missing out on nightlife.

Best of luck on your trip!","Why take a bus/train to Tokyo station? Take the train to Asakusa. Why spend the night in Shibuya when you barely got there and will likely be tired from your flight.

Day 3, no idea why there is a Kamakura mention, but you won‚Äôt go there on the same day as Kawaguchiko. Do you mean you do one or the other?

Day 4 look like ton of leftover ideas all put there. That is kind of a lot and in to many area of Tokyo.

The first Kyoto day seems to have way too much for not even a full day.

Overall, everything should be options, yes you can mark 1-2 priority each day, but just look at your itinerary during the day and decide what to do next. Sometimes it‚Äôs better to take time to enjoy something you like than just hop from one place to the other just for the sake of ticking all the boxes.",

After a 5 a.m. HND landing, keep day 1 light around Shinagawa and Shinjuku Gyoen, and save the Starbucks Reserve for a Nakameguro or Shibuya day. Kyoto is packed; make Kinkakuji optional or move it, start Fushimi early, then do Kiyomizu and wander Gion and Nishiki without rushing. Minoh Park pairs nicely with the CupNoodles Museum, and Himeji plus Kobe in one day is fine if you skip Mt. Shosha or trim Kobe to the ropeway and one area. Nintendo Museum with Uji and Byodo-in is a great combo, just watch timing if you want Jidai Matsuri. Back in Tokyo, teamLab with Tokyo Tower and Ginza flows well, and on the last day pick one anchor like Asakusa and Skytree, letting Ueno or Akihabara be the bonus. If a Fuji day tempts you, use [isfujivisible.com](http://isfujivisible.com) to scan the week and grab the day that looks clear. It saves you from guessing.","You might be underestimating the amount of travel (public transportation + walking) on Day 5, especially with Arashiyama. Have to factor in the time you spend at each place, plus time spent eating breakfast/lunch/dinner. Kyoto is a lot of walking, and sometimes it's better to walk than wait for the bus because of how crowded Kyoto is all the time.

Honestly, just skip your entire Day 9 and spend 3 nights in Kyoto as opposed to going back and forth from Osaka and Kyoto for 2 days straight on Days 7-8; Kyoto would become days 8-10. Don't rush your first trip. You'll tire yourself out with all the traveling. People underestimate how tiring it is to travel in Japan all the time. Also, limit yourself to one temple a day. There is such a thing as temple-fatigue. They'll all start to become the same to you after the 3rd or 4th one.

EDIT: Another thing about Kyoto, because of the crowd issues, is that many of their sites are best explored towards the evening. For example, the entire Gion district is nice to walk at night, and there's a lot of places to see around Gion distrcit. There's also Pontocho street/alley that is lively at night too. Kyoto at night is a different vibe.",,,

I'd love any kind of help as I am not sure if my itinery is missing anything or if I have crammed a lot of stuff that some may not be worth doing.",https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1n0aq3j/10_days_in_japan_itinerary_feedback_please/,"I would honestly skip TeamLabs. It was (by far) the most overrated thing I've been to in Tokyo. Just a place for people to take some pictures for their social media and in the end of the day its just rook after rokm with some sort of light installation.

Also annoying on how to get there with busses and such. It you only have 10.days, I would recommend using that time for more Tokyo or more time in Kyoto.

The rest of Odaibo same btw. The mall is overrated and the Gundam statue is cool, but not worth the effort /time. Unless you are a huge Gundam fan, its not worth the hassle","Day 3, you don‚Äôt exit into Takeshita Dori from Meiji.  They‚Äôre across the street from each other.  Yoyogi is next to Meiji and is just a park.  If you‚Äôre there too early nothing is open on Takeshita.  Also if you look down there and it‚Äôs a zoo, and you don‚Äôt need to go, don‚Äôt go.  

Not much to explore Shibuya crossing.  It‚Äôs a cross walk.  Hachiko is just a statue.

Day 5 is wishful thinking.","Day 5 is gonna be too much for a travel day given the distance between Tokyo and Kyoto, plus I assume you'll have a suitcase and may or may not be able to check in until 3pm if it's a standard hotel. Whereabouts is your hotel?

Fushimi Inari imo is best if you time it with sunset, less crowds and a nice view at the midway point. I also find Kikakuji nice but will be very crowded when there are other great temples. 

What time of year are you going?","Nothing much to see or do in Osaka, especially if you're not going to USJ, so I'd say just stay in Kyoto (it's much much nicer, trust me) and do a day trip to Osaka, which is only 15 mins by the shinkansen.

You can visit the Osaka Castle in the morning, then Kuromon Market. After lunch, just go to Shinsaibashi if you're more into shopping, or Umeda Sky if you don't, then spend the rest of your day in Dotonbori until night before heading back to Kyoto.",
1mzupfo,Itinerary Check: Late November/December 2025 Trip. Love to hear suggestions & recommendations!,"Hi everyone! I'll be visiting Japan in late November to December for 20 days full not including flight days. I'm landing in Osaka (KIX) and departing from Tokyo (HND).

As this is my first time going to Japan, I don't mind visiting more touristy places (especially in early December when it's not peak season yet, from what I've gathered, so potentially less crowds), but would also love to explore other hidden gems. I haven't booked any accommodations and appreciate suggestions for good neighborhoods I can stay in, advice on my tentative itinerary, and activities during this period (late November/early December is kind of a tricky period since it's late in the autumn foliage and not quite winter yet).

More about me: mid-twenties, in decent shape, enjoys both nature (light hiking) and city life, big fan of anime, manga, and volleyball, interested in history, and would love to explore the nightlife in Japan. I'm planning to bring 1 medium-sized suitcase, so I don't mind moving hotels more frequently to cut down commute time & transport costs.

I‚Äôm listing out all of the places that seem interesting based on the general area, but I haven‚Äôt arranged them in detail (morning, afternoon, evening), and obviously, I will not visit all of them each day. Just keeping my options open. 

This is my tentative itinerary:

29 Nov - Arrive in Osaka (16:00): Check-in hotel, Dotonbori

30 Nov ‚Äì Osaka: Osaka Castle, Watch a volleyball match (there are 3 teams based in Osaka/Kyoto), Shinsekai

1 Dec ‚Äì Osaka: USJ full-day

2 Dec ‚Äì Nara Day Trip: Kofukuji Temple, Todaiji Temple, Nigatsudo, Kasugi Taisha, Isuien Garden + Naramachi, last-minute Osaka explore (Namba, Shinshaibashi)

3 Dec ‚Äì Central Kyoto: Nijo Castle, Nishiki Market, To-ji Temple, Kyoto Gyoen National Garden, Pontocho

4 Dec ‚Äì Arashiyama (Western Kyoto): Arashiyama Bamboo Forest, Tenryu-ji, Gioji Temple, Adashino Nenbutsuji, Saga Toriimoto Preserved Street, Daihikaku Senk≈ç-ji Temple, Kinkakuji Temple

5 Dec ‚Äì Northern Kyoto: Kurama-dera, Kifune Shrine, Kibune River, Sanzen-in Temple, Gion

6 Dec ‚Äì Possible day trip to Uji/Amanohashidate

7 Dec ‚Äì Higashiyama (Eastern Kyoto): Fushimi Inari, Kiyomizu-dera, Koadiji Temple/Yasaka Shrine, Nanzen-ji, Ginkaku-ji, Gion

**Night bus to Option 1: Nagano or Option 2: Kanazawa (after 22:00)**

I am considering between 2 options for the middle of this trip  
Option 1: Osaka ‚Äì Kyoto ‚Äì Nagano ‚Äì Tokyo  
Option 2: Osaka ‚Äì Kyoto ‚Äì Kanazawa/Takayama/Shirakawago ‚Äì Tokyo  
I‚Äôm considering Nagano as a base because I'm interested in going to Togakushi Shrine, Jigokudani Monkey Park, and Tateishi Park/Lake Suwa. However, I‚Äôm unsure about the weather in early December (snow, autumn foliage, barren?). Hence, the alternative is the Kanazawa & Gifu area. Would love any advice on this! Which one should I choose, or are there any other options I can consider?

8 Dec ‚Äì Nagano: Togakushi Shrine, Murayama (Neko Machi Eki Sha - Ghibli themed cafe) / Kanazawa

9 Dec ‚Äì ¬†Nagano: Jigokudani Monkey Park, Shibu Onsen, Obuse Town / Shirakawago Day Trip

10 Dec ‚Äì Nagano: Narai-juku (Edo town vibes), Tateishi Park & Lake Suwa (Your Name lake inspiration) / Takayama

11 Dec ‚Äì Tokyo: Zenkoji Temple, Afternoon train/bus to Tokyo, Shinjuku

12-13 Dec ‚Äì Nikko: Toshogu Shrine, Rinno‚Äëji, Shinkyo Bridge, Kanmangafuchi Abyss, Lake Chuzenji, Kegon Falls, train to Tokyo

14 Dec ‚Äì Tokyo: Asakusa, Uneo

**For this part, I‚Äôm also undecided on whether I should go to Hakone or Mt. Fuji, and if I should stay overnight or do it as a day trip.**

15-16 Dec ‚Äì Hakone/Mt. Fuji: Hakone Ropeway, Lake Ashi cruise, Hakone Shrine OR Lake Kawaguchi, Panoramic Ropeway, Gotemba, Oshino Hakkai

17 Dec ‚Äì Tokyo: Ghibli Museum (will definitely book ticket in advance), Kichijoji, Asakusa, Akihabara

18 Dec ‚Äì Kamakura + Enoshima Day Trip

19 Dec ‚Äì Tokyo: Harajuku, Shibuya, Roppongi (will stay near Haneda)

20 Dec ‚Äì Morning flight (08:00)

For my tentative itinerary, I will most likely purchase the Japan Bus Pass (Willer Express) and would like to ask how comfortable/uncomfortable it is, especially for long/overnight travel. 

I‚Äôd really appreciate any insights, advice, adjustments, and recommendations to improve this itinerary. Is this doable, too packed, or not packed enough (I don't mind doing demanding schedules)? Are there any other destinations that I definitely shouldn't miss during my time there? I‚Äôm also open to rearranging the length of stays in each part of the trip (maybe longer in Osaka, less in Kyoto?).

Thanks for reading this lengthy post!",https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1mzupfo/itinerary_check_late_novemberdecember_2025_trip/,"> (late November/early December is kind of a tricky period since it's late in the autumn foliage and not quite winter yet)

I went to Japan in October 2023 and mid-late November 2024 and if those years are any indication, late November/early December isn't late in the fall foliage season at all. Look up the 2024 fall foliage reports and those dates are literally at the peak of the season. Obviously you'll want to check the forecasts for this year when they become available but I would genuinely plan my trip around seeing the best fall foliage sights if that's something you're interested in.","Your plan looks great! In December, Kanazawa/Takayama/Shirakawago usually have more charm than Nagano, unless you really want to see the snow monkeys. For Mt. Fuji, Kawaguchiko = best views (stay overnight), while Hakone = easiest day trip. Kyoto is a bit packed - cutting one or two temples will give you more time to just wander and enjoy. The Willer buses are safe and cheap, but overnight rides can be tiring, so mixing in some train travel will make things more comfortable!!!","Hey there

Nice itinerary going there. I can't comment on everything, but from what I read and from experience :

* You should arrive around peak foliage season. Be prepared for big crowds, especially in Kyoto. So plan on going on weekdays and/or early in the morning (before 10am)
* If you plan on visiting Osaka Castle, do note that this is more of a museum than a proper castle. An alternative is Himeji castle (which is around 90 minutes away from Osaka)
* Also, if you somehow manage to cram into your schedule, the Kaiyukan Aquarium is very nice
* For Hakone/Fuji, if you can accomodate 3 days, there are actually passes for the Hakone/Fuji region (found [here](https://www.odakyu.jp/english/passes/fujihakone), also offer 2/3 days passes for Hakone)
* For Ghibli museum, do note that reservations open at 10am JST the 10th of the month before (so in your case, november 10th), and that you have to book from the Lawson Website. Website's a nightmare. Lags heavily, when I was booking, I 503'd multiples times and overall took me an hour to book the tickets. I'd heavily recommend you start queuing at least an hour before the sale opens, and be very flexible on your schedule
* While going to/coming back from Ghibli museum, I'd also recommend stopping by Nakano Broadway, nice alternative to Akihabara","I‚Äôll be going in mid December (10th through the 26th!) and had the same debate about Nagano vs. Kanazawa. We decided on Nagano based on the added bonus of the monkey park and likelihood of snow in the region. ¬†I got a lot of feedback that it‚Äôs much more likely to have snow in December in Nagano vs. other areas. We‚Äôre planning one night at Shibu Onsen (Kokuya Ryokan) and going to the monkey park, followed by a day at Togakushi/exploring Nagano city. You could also add Matsumoto if you have another day-the castle and city museum of art look interesting!¬†",
1mxxcxw,9-day Planned Itinerary in Osaka‚ÄîNeed Advice,"Hello, travelers. My husband and I will be travelling to Japan for the first time this October. We'll be staying for 9d/8n. I need advice on whether the itinerary I planned is feasible or if there is any day I need to adjust to fully enjoy our trip.

Oct 14 ‚Äì Arrival at KIX. We booked a room at Smile Hotel Shin-Osaka for the whole trip. The location is convenient as it is close to Shin-Osaka Station and Nishinakajima-Minamigata Station.

Oct 15 ‚Äì Osaka Day Tour: Umeda Sky, Umeda Mall, Hep-Five Ferris Wheel, Osaka Castle, Dotonbori. I'm planning to buy a 1-day Osaka Amazing Pass.

Oct 16 ‚Äì Whole day at Universal Studios Japan. I wanted to visit WWOHP, and my husband wanted to visit SNW. Is getting an express pass 4 worth it? Any invaluable tips for USJ?

Oct 17 ‚Äì We'll go to Osaka Aquarium for half a day, Shinsekai, and Shitennoji Temple. For anyone who visited Osaka Aquarium in the past, is it better to visit during the morning or in the afternoon?

Oct 18 ‚Äì Katsuoji Temple, Yodogawa Fireworks Festival. We didn't get any seated tickets, so we will watch the show just like the locals. This is one of the reasons we wanted to come in October!

Oct 19 ‚Äì We'll have an overnight stay at Kinosaki Onsen. I'm planning to get the JR Kansai Wide Pass good for 5 days, given that the rest of our stay will be one-day trips around Osaka.

Oct 20 ‚Äì We'll leave Kinosaki Onsen at around 9am. And spend the rest of the day in Kyoto. This is the itinerary I planned so far: Nara Park, Kiyomizu-dera Temple, Yasaka Pagoda, and Nishiki Market. Do you think we can still squeeze in Todaiji Temple? I chose Kiyomizudera Temple over Fushimi Inari; any advice will be helpful. The last trip from Kyoto to Shin-Osaka is at 11PM.

Oct 21 ‚Äì Amanohashidate and Ine Bay

Oct 22 ‚Äì Kuromon Market in the morning and last-minute shopping before we head to the airport.

  
Best eSim to use? I have an iPhone and my husband is an adroid user.

Is it worth it to get a Suica or ICOCA card for the trip, or should we just stick with getting train tickets using cash for the first few days?

Thanks in advance!!",https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1mxxcxw/9day_planned_itinerary_in_osakaneed_advice/,"Oct. 20- Nara and Kyoto are different cities. Sarting at 9 from Kinosaki means you'll be arriving at least around noon at the first spot in Kyoto you want to visit. Temples will be closed by the time you get to Nara and it will probably be sunset or close to that time.


You need an IC card for convenience unless you like to waste time. In that region you find ICOCA, not SUICA.


Esim Ubigi or Airalo. Use the search function, it gets asked all the time.","Oct 20 and 21 don't make any sense geographically. 

Amanohashidate and Ine Bay are on the northern coast not all that far from Kinosaki yet you are travelling from Kinosaki on the morning of the 20th to head back to the Kyoto area only to return back north on the 21st? If anything you should do those on the 20th when you're leaving Kinosaki and already up in the region, saving a ton a time needlessly traveling back and forth.

As someone else has already said, Kyoto and Nara are two different cities. Nara Park and Todaiji are in Nara, not Kyoto like the others and trying to do both cities the same day you are coming back from Kinosaki seems kinda nuts to me. If you end up swapping days 20 and 21 so you start the Kyoto/Nara day from Osaka, that may be doable, but it's still going to be very ambitious and probably hectic.

I did the aquarium in the morning, as close to open as possible, since they sell tickets in 15 min blocks with a set number of tickets for each block so they can manage the crowds inside. If you reserve ahead of time, it probably doesn't matter as much, but if you just plan on heading over and buying tickets, I suggest going early. Also, for me, half of the appeal of Shinsekai is seeing it all lit up a night, so I would suggest doing that later in the day after the aquarium.","Don't know if your stops were written out of order or thats' your schedule, so I'll just point out for safety's sake:  

* Oct 15: Go to Osaka Castle in the morning, it's the one that will close the earliest. Do Dotonbori last, it's best on the night. Hep 5 is also better on a night view, on the morning it's just watching grey buildings.  
* Oct 16: If you want a guaranteed entry to Nintendo World, yes, get the express pass. Harry Potter should be safe even without it.  
* Oct 17: Do shinsekai last, it's also better at night.  
* Oct 18: If you're already doing Katsuo-ji, get a taxi to the top of the Minoo waterfalls and walk it downstream; nice views and not too tiring. For the fireworks, be aware you'll need to be there at least 2 hours early to get a good spot.  
* Oct 19: I hope you took an onsen with the pass for the ""6 legendary onsen"" so you can try the others.  
* Oct 20:...  

This one needs a whole revamp.  
First; how is the luggage logistic? Will you have left it on Osaka for your Kinosaki trip? Will you send it through the Onsen back to your Osaka hotel? will you stop first in Osaka and then go to Nara/Kyoto? will you drag it all day?  
Either way, all shrines an temples close at 5pm, which, considering 3h from Kinosaki back to Osaka or Nara or Kyoto at 7am, gives you pretty much 6h for all of this. 7 at best.  
I can picture Kinosaki>>Nara arriving at 10am, doing the Deer Park, the Todaiji (this is a must if you're going to Nara) and be done in 3-4h, which leaves you no time to move to Kyoto and have time for much.  

Personally, I have never understood the hype for the Nishiki Market, nor Kuromon Market but that's me.  

* Oct 21: Amanohashidate and the bay its waay too off course for too little reward in my opinion. I'd suggest changing this for Fushimi Inari and a whole day in Kyoto. BUT IF YOU MUST, then better do it on the 20th so you don't have the pressure of the time on your head, unlike with the shrines, that DO close early.  
* Oct 22: I care little for the market, and depending how early you're leaving, everything may be closed already.  

If you're still in a position to change hotel bookings, I'd advice this:  

* Plan A: Do Kinosaki LAST (Oct 21) so you depart directly from there to the airport (IDK your departure time so no clue if this is viable).  
* Plan B: Once you leave Osaka for Kinosaki, book a hotel in Kioto and stay there the rest of the trip. It's more efficient.   
* Plan C: Do your Kioto trips first and the Osaka things last (Except the fireworks day, that ofc it's not transferrable) so even if you go back to Osaka from Kinosaki, you aren't rushing to then get to Nara or Kioto.  

Either way, I'd suggest this changes:  

* Oct 15: Osaka Aquarium + Shittenno-ji + Shinsekai. Start easy.  
* Oct 16: Katsuo-ji + Minoo + Umeda + Dotonbori. More active.
* Oct 17: USJ. Ultra active.   
* Oct 18: Osaka Castle + Yodogawa Fireworks. Best to already be on the area than all the way to Minoo, and a lighter load.  
* Oct 19: Kinosaki Onsen. Full relaxation.  
* Oct 20: Fushimi Inari. It will eat your morning, but there is no closing time so no need to rush from Kinosaki, you can take it easy on your return timing and still get it done. And if you're staying in Osaka, you could go to Abeno Harukas for the night view on the observatory floor for free at night so it's not a ""wasted day"".  
* Oct 21: Kiyomizudera, Yasaka Pagoda, Kennin-ji, Ryozen Kannon, Kodai-ji. If you're going to Kyoto, you gotta see the shrines! And if you start early, you can cram a good ammount in the same zone.  
* Oct 22: Free day.  


Last: Get the SUICA or ICOCA. It's less risk of mistakes on your ticket selection, its only 500 yen and a nice souvenir. Also works on buses so you never have to worry about having coins on hand.  
I also suggest a pocket wifi over E-sim. Less compatibility risks.","I went to Osaka Aquarium in the afternoon, it was a nice couple hours.

For USJ try to book your timed entry for Super Nintendo World ASAP. You're more likely to get an early slot, which improves your husband's chances of getting on all three rides.",

Unless you or someone in your group tires easily, this density is fine. Also depends on if your travel style is ""take it easy"" or ""go out and do stuff"".","Your agenda is doing a lot of back and forth travel, and that eats a lot of time. Pick a direction and move that way.  
e.g.. Tokyo-> Hakone -> Kyoto-> Osaka-> Hiroshima -> Okinawa -> Home (Connect through Tokyo), or reverse it, and connect to an Okinawa flight as soon as you land in Narita, that way your first travel day is maximized while you're jetlagged and lethargic.
  
But Honestly, I'd cut Okinawa out. It's a pretty large reposition, and it's absence, plus better routing, makes this agenda a little more reasonable.","I definitely wouldn‚Äôt skip Osaka like another commenter said, but agree this schedule is way too busy. You need time to just wonder around, or to go back to that one place you stumbled on but weren‚Äôt hungry enough to try or had time to check out.

Osaka is great, and Dontonburi would be a fun first night! But there‚Äôs so much travel In this schedule, you‚Äôre going to be spending half your trip on transit. Definitely dial it back a bit if you can.",
1mrvqzp,"Itinerary Check, early October","Hello, this will be my first visit to Japan, and it will be for 11 days. Below is a itinerary that is hopefully in it's kinda final version lol; any input appreciated.

Oct 9 (Arrival in Tokyo): Arrive at Narita at around 7PM, take the Keisei Narita Skyaccess to Asakusa Station, and check into the hotel, maybe late dinner or just sleep.

Oct 10 (Tokyo): Explore Meiji Jingu Shrine and Yoyogi Park, then Takeshita Street in Harajuku and Omotesando.

Oct 11 (Tokyo): Shibuya Crossing and Hachiko Statue, Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building, and Shinjuku spots like Omoide Yokocho and Golden Gai.

Oct 12 (Tokyo): Akihabara, Senso-ji Temple, Nakamise-dori and overall Asakusa.

Oct 13 (Tokyo): Ginza, Imperial Palace East Garden.

Oct 14 (Tokyo): This is an optional day with two choices:

* Option 1: Take a Sumida River Cruise to Odaiba to see the Rainbow Bridge and visit TeamLab Planets.
* Option 2: Go to Tokyo Tower, see Zojoji Temple, and explore Roppongi.
* Leaning more on option 1 tbh

Oct 15 (Hakone): Travel to Hakone, spend the day at the Hakone Open-Air Museum and on the Hakone Loop. Dinner and onsen at a ryokan.

Oct 16 (Kyoto): After breakfast, take the Shinkansen to Kyoto Station, check in and random exploring

Oct 17 (Nara Day Trip): Nara Park, Todai-ji Temple, Kasuga Taisha Shrine, and Kofuku-ji Temple. Idk if I should just get back earlier to Kyoto and just stroll around there, or stay in Nara until later in the evening

Oct 18 (Kyoto): Golden Pavilion, the Ryoan-ji Temple rock garden, and the Arashiyama Bamboo Grove and if time allows the monkey park. Afterwards, Fushimi Inari-taisha Shrine and the Gion District.

Oct 19 (Osaka): Travel to Osaka and check-in. In the afternoon, Osaka Castle, Shinsekai area, and dinner in Dotonbori.

Oct 20 (Osaka): Go to the Umeda district for some shopping, then Umeda Sky Building.

Oct 21 (Departure): Breakfast and then go to the airport for departure in the evening



Please let me know if it‚Äôs too much, or if I missed some essentials, or something that could be removed etc. I tried keeping a balance between seeing and experiencing things, but not have it be very tiring‚Ä¶hopefully.

I have some questions about logistics; I read about luggage forwarding. Is this something I can do as soon as I arrive at Narita? I know it takes a day for it to arrive, so I would have a hand luggage with some clothes until it arrives. Also, it means that I should do the forwarding on Oct 19 for it to be at the airport on Oct 21 right? Or should I just leave with the luggage straight from the hotel?

I know that cash is king sometimes, but upon arrival, can I get away with just getting a suica, topping it up and then going straight to the hotel, and checking an ATM the next day? Or I would really need some cash when I land?

",https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1mrvqzp/itinerary_check_early_october/,"I recommend that you save a day to do a day trip to the Enoshima/Kamakura area, preferably on a clear sunny so make it flexible. I always recommend this if it's your first time coming to Tokyo. I think the sunset from there is very memorable and on good days, you could even see mount Fuji. I recommend viewing from [this spot](https://maps.app.goo.gl/xx6bopF88fJ6GA9y9)

Yes you can immediately send your luggage to your hotel once you arrive in Narita. You should probably check your train connections to your hotel and see if it's convenient enough for you to carry your luggage around. And yes you need to send it on the 19th before 10AM. If it's later than that there might be a chance that they won't accept it.

If you can't get a suica or passmo on your phone, I recommend using it exclusively for transport. It can kind of be inconvenient trying to charge your IC card since you have to take out cash and refill it at a station, konbini, or at some ATMs. You can get by alot with only using a debit/credit card, and carry at least 10/20k yen for emergency cash when you can't use card.","JAL now has a same day luggage delivery service, I see ads for them online.  Also the river trip between Odaiba and Asakusa doesnt take more than an hour at most, (can't remember) but it depends if you are counting the Team Labs and possibly 2 hours there.",Following as I‚Äòm considering a similar trip. thanks,,
1mrepy9,Itinerary Check - 2 weeks late September / Early October,"Hi everyone! After a lot of planning, a lot of reading all the helpful tips and tricks here, I finally have a somewhat finalized itinerary for my wife and mine first trip to Japan. It's been our lifelong dream, and I can't believe it is so close!

A bit of ourselves before I ask a few questions, to make it easier for any suggestions. 

We're in our early 30s, love to travel and explore new cultures. In our trips we usually try to avoid having a super strict schedule in favor of just exploring and seeing where the place takes us. (Kyoto being the exception this time because there's so much I want to see lol)

We love nature, music and videogames.

We are foodies and love Japanese food, and can't wait to try everything there. Probably what my wife's most excited.

I'm a huge videogame and mainly Nintendo nerd. We're not so much into anime nowadays, but grew up watching the classics (Pokemon, Dragonball, Digimon, Sakura Card Captor, etc)

My wife loves thrift shopping and is looking to add some stylish pieces to her wardrobe this trip. Despite that, we're not hugely focused in shopping (although I know we're probably gonna pick up a few things)

  
Alright, here we go:

  
**Sunday - September 28th**

*12:35pm - Arriving in Tokyo - Narita*

We head straight to Kyoto via Shinkansen, so we plan on forwarding our bigger luggage to our hotel while still at the airport.

Take the Narita Express to Shinagawa Station, and then take the Shinkansen to Kyoto

I'm estimating we'll be getting to our hotel at around 6 - 7 pm (please let me know if this is unrealistic lol)

Probably gonna just find somewhere to grab dinner and go rest. (If I can gather the energy I'd love to take a stroll around Ninnenzaka at night since our hotel is close by)

  
**Monday - September 29th**

*8am: Kiyomizu-dera, Walk around Sannenzaka / Ninnezaka, Explore the area*

Would gladly take any suggestions on what to see / eat around this area, as our next scheduled activity is only at 2pm.

*2pm - Nintendo Museum (managed to get tickets yay!)*

Estimating to spend about 2 hrs there

*4:30 - 5pm - Arrive at Fushimi Inari*

Gonna try to hike all the way up during sunset / night. I was told is pretty well lit and beautiful at night.

After Fushimi Inari we're pretty open. Thinking of just exploring the area and finding a nice place to have dinner.

  
**Tuesday - September 30th**

We're taking a trip up to Kibune to go have a coffee at Hyoue Cafe, this place on top of a river that my wife found on Intagram and is obsessed since lol I know it is about a 2 hour trip via public transportation so I'm planning on breaking that up with some stuff on our way up.

*7am - Breakfast at a convenience store and head to Kibune*

*\~8 am - stop to go to Enkoji temple on the way (saw that this temple also has a bamboo grove so we decided to skip Arashiyama to go here)*

*9 am -  back on our way to Kibune*

*10 am - 12 pm: go to Hyoue Cafe and also explore Kifune Shrine around the area*

After this, our day is kinda open. I plan on hitting this afternoon:

Nishiki Market for lunch

Kyoto Imperial Palace

And then at night a stroll around Gion / Pontocho

Would love to fit Philospher's Path somewhere here but not sure if any of this is realistic.

  
**Wednesday - October 1st (it's our 14th anniversary)**

*8am: Checking out / forward luggages to Osaka / go to Arashiyama Money Park*

If in any case we don't have time to go Fushimi Inari on the 29th, I'm ready to replace the Monkey Park with it, but would love to do both.

*11:30am - 2pm: Trip to Kinosakionsen / check in the ryokan*

Then it's just exploring Kinosaki, going to a few public baths, and walking around. We have a dinner reservation in our hotel for 6pm and then a private onsen at 8:30pm.

  
**Thursday - October 2nd**

*Morning: Check out and take the ropeway up the mountain. Try to hit one more onsen after that*

*1pm - 3:30ish pm: Shinkansen to Osaka*

Check in, get our bags. Settle for a bit.

Then explore Dotonbori at night, having some street food and doing whatever we find interesting (will take recommendations!)

  
**Friday - October 3th**

*8am - 3pm: Universal Studios (Mainly Super Nintendo World)*

After that get back to the hotel, take a shower and head to spend the evening exploring Shinsekai.

  
**Saturday - October 4th**

*9am - 2pm: Daytrip to Himeji Castle*

*3pm: Get back to Osaka / Explore Shinsaibaishi area maybe?*

This evening we're considering doing that Izakaya Crawl tour on Klook. Anyone here done that? Any thoughts? We'd love to hit Karaoke too.

  
**Sunday - October 5th**

*Morning: Go to Namba Yasaka Jinja Shrine and explore a bit of Namba*

*Afternoon: Visit the Nakanoshima library and then explore Tenma for some Isakaya Happy Hour hopefully*

*Evening: Umeda area / Umeda Sky Building*

We're keeping this day pretty flexible so would love your recommendations for things to do in these areas I'm planning to explore. 

  
**Monday - October 6th**

*Morning: Check out, forward our luggage to Tokyo, find somewhere for breakfast*

*11am - 1pm: Shinkansen to Hiroshima / Check in the hotel*

*2pm - 6pm: Peace Park and Museum*

*Evening: have dinner somewhere nice (preferably good okonomiyaki)*

  
**Tuesday - October 7th**

*8am: Check out / breakfast*

*9am - 4pm: Explore Miyajima Island*

*6pm - 8pm: Flight tand arrival in Tokyo / Have dinner near our hotel in Ginza*

  
**Wednesday - October 8th**

*9am - 11am: Teamlabs Planets*

*12 - 3pm: Senso-ji Temple / Explore Asakusa / Stroll around Kappabashi*

*3 - 6pm: Explore Akihabara / Retro game shopping*

*Night: Head to Tokyo Skytree Area (gonna try to make reservations to Kirby Cafe for dinner, if I can't l'd love recommendations on where to eat around here!)*

My main question with this day is: too packed? How realistic is this schedule considering distances / transportation between the areas?

  
**Thursday - October 9th (I'm leaving this and the following day flexible to go to Mt Fuji depending on weather/visibility)**

*6 am - 9am : Trip to Mt Fuji* 

Since we don't know if we're going or not until the day before, I won't reserve any trains or buses so I assume I'll have to take public transit and that takes longer

*9am - 3pm: Chureito Pagoda, Fujiyoushida, Kawaguchiko / Back to Tokyo*

Question about Fuji day: is it worth going even if the visibility index is around 6- 7? In other words, is it worth it even if not perfectly clear skies?

*6am - evening: Arrive back in the hotel / go out to eat and explore near Tokyo Station (Any recommendations?*

We go back home in 2 days from here (Oct 11th). Should we already forward our luggage to Narita? Or can we do it one day before our flight?

  
**Friday - October 10th**

*Morning: Explore Shibuya*

*Afternoon: Explore Meiji Jingu / Harajuku*

*Evening: Explore Shinjuku / Golden Gai*

Again pretty flexible day. We for sure want to explore these 3 areas but would love recommendations on where to eat / what to see. We'd love if we could catch an indie artist gig for some live music. Is Shinjuku a good place for that?

  
**Saturday - October 11th**

*9am - 12pm : Check out / Walk around Imperial Palace before heading back to the airport*

*1pm: Head back to the airport and then home*

  
OK that was a lot! If you've read through all of this, thank you and if you answer any questions I had / recommend stuff thank you 1000x more!",https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1mrepy9/itinerary_check_2_weeks_late_september_early/,"Sannenzaka will be crowded at that time, I would rather go there earlier or late at night (just for the views). Nintendo Museum + Fushimi Inari - will be quite rushed imo. I ended up spending 2.5hours in the museum alone (you'll need time if you want to play the games there/ shop at the museum - usually is crowded). Even otherwise Uji is pretty nice by itself - might spend time exploring the place rather than rushing back to Kyoto for Fushimi Inari (i would've skipped the monkey park) 

Saw you listed Philosopher's Path as well - but I suppose there'll be nothing much to see at this time of the year

Going all the way back to Asakusa after doing teamLabs Planets - it'll definitely be pretty rushed. Likewise, if you're going just for the views might go at night else if you pray, be prepared for the crowds 

Overall, the itinerary seems good (and fairly full) to me but you might want to bake in some more time for logistics","The Tokyo parts look busy but OK, unless you plan on going into shops and stuff like that, in which case they're probably too packed.",Hello! How did you get to get the Nintendo museum ticket?,Wow my wife and I (in our early 30s as well) are also traveling to Japan late September (reaching on 27th),

I am not ever sure if this is actually feasible. Unless, you are sonic the hedgehog","Kanawaza is pretty far for a day trip.

I think its worth staying overnight.

Regardless if you stay overnight or not, use it as a stop between Tokyo and Kyoto.  It doesn't make sense to return to Tokyo, when Kyoto is closer and you are going there next anyway.

Also, look into the Kansai Hiroshima area JR pass.  That is probably your best deal to just buy that pass for the Hiroshima segment of your trip.","It's ridiculous. I love going outside of Tokyo city central but if you're spending that much time in the suburbs as day trips, you may as well rent a car and make a trip out of it and make it your priority on your trip.

Going back and forth on the train kills a lot of your time and you don't gaurentee a seat so you have to stand the whole way back after your hikes and walking around all day.

I just don't think your itinerary sounds fun, unless you have chauffeur that takes you to every place you list, then maybe it's more doable.","A day trip to Kanazawa from Tokyo is really not possible, that is like 7 hours of travel minimum, and you have a super full itinerary for there already. You would have to do that as an overnight trip. You are basically taking long trips to/from Tokyo on 4 straight days which will not give you any time at all to enjoy the places you are going. You need to pick 1-2 and commit to those, you can't do everything in one trip.",

I type this on my plane back from Tokyo. The heat was miserable. I live in Alabama in the US and thought I would handle the humidity fine. It makes doing any type of walking or outdoor activity nearly impossible. We spent hundreds on Ubers trying to get around during the heat of the day, saving the local transport for the evenings when it‚Äôs not AS hot. Wait until fall if you can. I really regret it.","I would strongly advise against going to Japan in the summer unless you absolutely have to. It is so suffocatingly hot and that comes from someone who lives in the American South. We did Toyko and Kyoto in early September, only because we wanted to hike Mt Fuji (hiking season ended 9/10). I don't regret it because of the amazing experience of our hike, but it is 100% not worth it otherwise.¬†


If you want to hit all the rides, I recommend getting to the Disney parks like an hour early. People queue up (very neatly) far in advance of park opening. We had a blast at Disney.


We are also huge Studio Ghibli fans, and people will probably disagree on this, but we did not enjoy the Ghibli Museum. Everything is in Japanese and you cant take photos, so no Google translate. So the Museum was just kind of looking at cute pictures. The building is fun and Kichijoji was a cute getaway from Tokyo, but just as a forewarning.","I would strongly advise against checking changing hotels between Ikebukuro and Kichijoji. They are not far apart, and you will lose much more time checking in and out and transporting luggage than you will save in travel time by changing locations (and, for day 5, you will add to your travel time).","If you can move your honeymoon from the summer to October, that‚Äôs probably the better move given the heat in Japan. Would you also consider going outside of Tokyo? You‚Äôre not far from Kyoto or smaller areas like Kanazawa and Takayama, which probably have more of a honeymoon vibe. Personally I thought Disney was not great. It was cute but you have to realistically wait 1-3 hours per good ride which only lasts a few seconds.",
1naxjea,"Trip Report: 6 days in Okinawa (captured on film) with 2 days at Junglia, an honest review","**Day 1 Naha**

We flew into Naha in the afternoon, basically the day before our holiday officially started, which means we avoided the horror of a 6AM airport dash and got to enjoy a cost-effective business hotel near Asahibashi Station. Doing this was cheaper than flying in the next day (Saturday morning), so basically spent money to save money. Added bonus was the welcome drink and inclusive breakfast.

**Day 2 Onna and Kouri island**

Drove up to Onna where naturally we didn‚Äôt have time for all the marine activities. Hence we opted for most difficult and demanding one as first-time newbies, the flyboards.  
After that, we did normal beach things: chilling, relaxing, and playing at the pool.  
By evening, we stopped at a supermarket before continuing on to our AirBnB on Kouri island, which is connected to the mainland by 1 very long and scenic bridge. Made dinner, played some games and winded down for the night.

**Day 3 BBQ, Pool and Junglia\***

The AirBnB had a BBQ grill, a pool, jacuzzi and sauna, so of course we didn‚Äôt have time for everything, so opted to play in the pool before firing up the grill for lunch. After lunch we went to Junglia! We stayed there until closing time.

**Day 4 Junglia Round 2, Night Pool and Sauna**

We started out by heading to Junglia in the morning and went on a few attractions until the afternoon. Then went to the Junglia spa (with a pretty awesome infinity pool!) after sweating the day away. We made it back to our little island before it got dark, ate at a delicious albeit slightly pricey ‚Äòtropical cuisine‚Äô restaurant, before winding down playing in the pool at night this time, and getting warm in the sauna room as well.

**Day 5 Churaumi Aquarium and Sesoko island**

Checked out of the first property by 10AM and drove west to Churaumi Aquarium. Parked the car and explored a bit the surrounding the area and found a nice spot to eat (even had some live cows nearby!). After lunch we headed back towards Churaumi (at one point had the largest aquarium tank in the world), still massive, with the iconic whale shark! Plus there were so many other sea animals and creatures. Even without factoring in the much-needed respite from the extreme heat, this aquarium was the best I‚Äôve been to ever.

After Churaumi, we drove a bit south from there to Sesoko island (another island connected by 1 bridge üòä). Checked into our second property, played at the local beach, and ate dinner at an awesome (and very pricey) Okinawa barbecue spot (fresh local ingredients including the meat, with the cattle and all produce being raised and processed by the owner).

**Day 6 Until next time, Okinawa**

Had time for a bit more beach fun before driving back down to Naha and getting a lift to Akamine, which is 1 stop from the airport on the monorail. We had lunch at a delicious (this time cost-effective!) seafood place which was definitely decorated Okinawan style (whale sharks galore). We then flew out!

If you read this far and want to also watch an overview of our trip, I uploaded it to [**YouTube**](https://youtu.be/UcNaqLLzBfk) (5 minute video).

\*About Junglia... We went 2-3 weeks after it officially opened, so going into this I accepted that we'd be somewhat beta testing the experience before it improves over time. Generally, we had a good time. But if you do go and you don't intend to buy those premium passes, just be wary of what they call ""numbered tickets"". Numbered tickets are free, but they're just that, numbered/limited. We arrived at the official opening time of 10AM, but the numbered tickets were already gone. So if you want some, I'd recommend arriving before 09:30. You can get them after entering the park on the day of your visit. Unfortunately, a lot of the attractions aren't accessible outside of premium passes and numbered tickets. So if you don't want to spend extra on premium passes, then you're limited to the standard pass (i.e. the regular 1 day ticket) and numbered tickets.",https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1naxjea/trip_report_6_days_in_okinawa_captured_on_film/,Thank you very much for the report. We're planning another Japan trip with Okinawa being the next destination. I may get back to you with a few questions in future if that's ok.,"Did you read reviews of Junglia before going?  It seems like little more than a scam or scheme to go to Northern areas

Curious-- how did you end up in Okinawa in the 1st place?   Friends in the service?",,,

1n7ne4e,Itinerary Check/Advice on Family's First Japan Trip,"Hello,

I will be going to Japan for the first time with my 62-year-old mother and my sister. I have tried to compile the things we want to do by area, but I am open to tips or suggestions. My mother has some health issues that may impact walking super long distances. Does my current itinerary seem doable? I am also worried about whether we have too much/too little scheduled on some days. Any suggestions on what to do in some of the places? We already have our flights and hotels booked, but certain places could be changed. And any additional first-time tips would be greatly appreciated.

Head to Narita and spend time at the airport/nearby area until the flights",https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1n7ne4e/itinerary_checkadvice_on_familys_first_japan_trip/,"Is relative mobility also an issue in addition to the distance?  Just asking because getting to Kiyomizudera isn‚Äôt the most stable walk.  Either a pretty good sized incline or the streets of Ninenzaka and Sannenzaka aren‚Äôt the smoothest (rocks, it‚Äôs rocks).  

The Starbucks you‚Äôre referring to on day 3 is in Ninenzaka which is in front of Kiyomizudera.

Day 6 is probably too much.  Fushimi Inari is a hike.

Day 7 is also probably too much because of how far things are.  The cup noodle museum is pretty far from central Osaka and you have to travel from Kyoto first and you have to drop your luggage first.

Day 13, no way would I try to travel to Hakone, do Hakone then move onto Tokyo in one day.  You also need slower days sprinkled in here somewhere.

Day 16, Takeshita Dori is fantastic place to get claustrophobia.

I think you‚Äôre vastly underestimating the time it takes to get from place to place.  Like fujiyoshida to Hakone is already 3+ hours.

Also underestimating how much go go go you or especially your mother can handle.  A few days is probably fine but 20 straight is going to get rough, fast.  I would need a few more slower days in between all of the amusement parks, day trips, long train rides and I‚Äôm not 62.","You‚Äôve listed quite a few places same days that are not directly close by, it‚Äôs worth focusing on 1-2 activities per day to be safe and keep the rest as suggestions. Give yourself the option to chill out all afternoon when you‚Äôre tired or sit in a cute cafe for 2 hours. 

For instance your hotel in Kyoto is 1h+ from most of the places you want to visit (Arashiyama, Fushimi Inari, Nara‚Ä¶) then Fushimi Inari is 35min from Imperial Palace and Ginkakujicho is another 35min from there by bus, then you need to return to your hotel 1h30 away. I wouldn‚Äôt want to do them all same day, in fact I did Fushimi at sunrise, walked around Gion, had lunch, and collapsed at 2pm for the day mid-trip lol","Kaiyukan aquarium is generally busy but not overwhelmingly so, I've been many times and never had any issues. Still, the earlier you arrive the better.

Tempozan Ferris Wheel is definitely still open.",,

No interest in Kasuga Taisha in Nara? 
Make sure you go to the Kintetsu and not JR station.

Consider spending the night in Matsumoto on the way to Fujikawaguchiko. Or head to Shinjuku from Kanazawa, and do fuji between switching hotels in Tokyo.

Would you go to Fujikawaguchiko even if Fuji weren't visible?

Why are you staying in mosly airbnbs?",FYI: nothing is open in Jimbocho until After 10am.,"You're missing the infamous Chureito Pagoda on your to-do while at Kawaguchiko. I would put it on Day 13 since you don't have much planed. Go super early, like 5-6 a.m. early and get there by sunrise. Come back and ride bikes around the lake. There are rentals across from Kawaguchiko Station. Definitely eat before riding bikes. After that, go buy snacks/food/drinks from the super market called OGINO to take back to your room and just relax.

Also, fun fact, or maybe not so fun fact, the suicide forest is close by to Kawaguchiko. I think you can get there on the green bus route; there are 5 (?) colored routes. 

What's your accommodation in Kawaguchiko?

Also, for Nippori, if it wasn't already part of your plans, don't forget to go to Yanaka Ginza while you're there. I would make that the first stop in Nippori.

Eat dinner + drinks on Ameyoko street in Ueno.",

1ndqmem,"Itinerary advice wanted: Tokyo -> Alps -> Osaka (17 days) - looking for cool Alps tips, hikes & routes through nature!","My gf & I are going to Japan in October for a little over two weeks. I've been there before (5 weeks, mostly highlights in Kanto, Kansai, Chugoku & Kyushu), gf has not. We don't have that long in Japan for this visit (17 days, 16 full days really), and our travel plans can be divided into two categories: 1) Classic city highlight stuff (mostly) along the southern side of Honshu, and 2) the (mostly Ch≈´bu) Alps.

The current itinerary looks something like this:

* Tokyo (will land here; probably would like to spend 2, max 3 nights here to check out the city
* Alps stuff (mostly Ch≈´bu): very doubtful & overwhelmed about this category, but possibilities after Tokyo would include:
   * Kamikochi
   * Matsumoto
   * Nagano
   * Alpine Route / Toyama
   * Kanazawa
* Kyoto (imo can't visit Japan without visiting Kyoto)
* Hiroshima & Miyajima (gf is interested in the Peace Memorial Museum and I have fond memories of Miyajima (am strongly considering skipping Hakone for this))
   * Kyoto & Hiroshima&Miyajima not necessarily in that order
   * Possibly squeezing Kobe in, but I'm sure we'll have to make choices and this would be one to strike off
* Osaka (will depart from here, and would like to spend 2 nights here

I feel quite confident about my capabilities to plan category 1 (due to my past experience), but am struggling with part 2, the Alps part. The level of detail I provide here is not the exact level of detail I've got going on in my personal itinerary, but it's definitely symbolic, which is a shame since we'd really love to have *most* of the trip be centered around nature: visiting national parks in the alps, travelling along scenic routes in nature, doing some semi-serious hiking & running. I am (just like last time I was planning my trip to Japan) just a bit daunted by all the info available (although [www.japan-guide.com](http://www.japan-guide.com) helps a lot).

I was wondering if you kind folks could:

* share experiences or advice to make for a manageable trip with not too restless of an itinerary (in terms of not sleeping just one night in every place)
* advise me on the order I planned in general, or certain spots which I mention or don't mention
* advise me if car rental is a helpful idea for the Alps part of the journey
* share other tips that might be useful (my prevous trip was in 2016, so it's been a while)

Thanks so much in advance, I hope I've shared enough info, if not glad to elaborate.",https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1ndqmem/itinerary_advice_wanted_tokyo_alps_osaka_17_days/,"We are also traveling the Japanese alps very soon so maybe our plans can give you some inspiration on where to stay for how long.
https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravelTips/s/KvPDgUVbnL

Current modifications are:
We hike mount chougatake stay the night there and the next day walk out kamikochi to our ryokan. Hike mount yake from our ryokan the next day.
This is because booking the karasawa mountains huts was extremely difficult in our travel period so we had to adjust. Make sure you have backup plans just in case.

We planned our trip around a festival in Takayama and wanting to do kamikochi on weekdays to have less crowds. Otherwise we would have tried fit in the Tateyama Kurobe alpine route as well

We are renting cars twice, one around nagano and the other to travel from takayama to kanazawa via shirakawago. We couldnot figure out the bus system with what to reserve and what not.

In the apls I am personally looking forward to visiting Kamikochi and obuse the most. Obuse is this cute village fanous for its chesnuts.
Also exploring Hakuba and visiting Happo pond.","When in October will you be here? For the Alps part, if it‚Äôs near peak fall color season are you willing to put up with the crowds?

It‚Äôs a trade off. It could be spectacular, but depending on your crowd tolerance, just frustrating. I‚Äôm thinking of this specifically for the Kamikochi and alpine route parts.",,,

Questions:
	1.	We‚Äôre semi-interested in catching a baseball playoff game if an Osaka or Hiroshima team makes it ‚Äî how realistic is it for foreigners to get tickets?
	2.	We‚Äôve got a lot of free time in Osaka. Since it‚Äôs my 3rd visit, any off-the-beaten-path spots you‚Äôd recommend beyond the basics?
	3.	For the Shimanami Kaido (Onomichi ‚Üí Imabari, main path), what are the must-stop places along the way?
	4.	Overall, does this itinerary feel doable without being stressful?
	5.	Bonus: My friend is allergic to soy and sesame. How manageable is that in Japan, and what foods should be his go-tos?",https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1ndtsb1/japan_itinerary_review_105_to_1019/,,,,,
1ndu8om,Advice on 10-15 day itinerary for November?,"Hey y'all! Was just wondering if I could get some advice on this itinerary. I'm planning a quasi-family trip+late honeymoon for mid\~late November. My husband and I are going with my brother and dad, who will join us for the first 10 days and then we'll be staying another 5 days.

My brother and I have both been to Japan (through an exchange program), but it's been over a decade so we're excited to see Tokyo and Kyoto again, but also explore Hakone and Osaka which we never got to see. My husband and dad have never been to Japan.

My husband is the most excited for food and attempting to talk to locals (even though he knows basically 0 Japanese). My dad is spry for a guy over 70 years old, he's easygoing but overall prefers nature. My brother is looking at shopping and hitting up interesting places he's seen online. I'm just happy with anything so long as I get some breaks from the crowds!

**NOTE:** Accommodations have been reserved for the first 10 days, but *not* for the rest of the trip. So Tokyo-Hakone-Osaka is more set in stone, but the rest are not if you guys have other suggestions. There's also reservations for the Nintendo Museum in Kyoto on Day 7 that we have to make it to, but other than that I haven't made very specific plans.

**DAY 1**: Land in Tokyo Haneda in the mid-afternoon. Stuck between these two choices:

A) Send luggage to our hostel, and go to the Unicorn Gundam, making our way to Tsukiji Market (or the Monjayaki district) before going to hostel in Asakusa. My brother and husband want to see this area, but I hear mixed things about it.

B) Just go straight to our hostel in Asakusa and explore that area. Get dinner, see Senso-ji. Maybe Skytree if we feel up for it, but I feel we're close enough we could stop by any of the days.

**DAY 2**: Imperial Palace to Akihabara to Ueno Park, or a different day trip. The Imperial Palace could be dropped if it doesn't seem to work, my dad was interested but it isn't a make or break deal for him.

**DAY 3**: Shibuya (my husband wants to see Hachiko, and my brother and I want to visit some shops), to Harajuku and the Meiji Jingu/Yoyogi park area.

**DAY 4**: Check out in the morning, send luggage to hostel in Hakone. Head to Shinjuku. Hopefully with some time to eat and explore!

Hop on train to Gotemba. Either go to outlets or straight to an onsen before heading to our hostel in Gora district.

**DAY 5**: Walk over to Hakone Open-Air Museum before it gets busy. Use the cable car to go to Lake Ashi. Explore. Maybe a public onsen.

**DAY 6**: Check out. Send luggage to Osaka. Make our way down Hakone, through Hakone Checkpoint, to Mishima Sky Walk.

Take Mishima Station to the house we're staying at in Osaka.

**DAY 7**: Wake up real early to go to Kyoto and hit up Fushimi Inari. From there decide if we want to go to Nishiki Market or Nijou Castle.

Make our way down to the Nintendo Museum. Explore Uji, get dinner or sake and head back to Osaka.

**DAY 8**: Osaka-focused day. Dotonbori and Osaka Castle, absolutely. Lots of focus on the food, but any specific suggestions would be great.

**DAY 9**: Day trip to Nara! Nara Park for sure, Kofukuji, Heijo Palace.

**DAY 10**: Dad and brother make their way back to Tokyo to fly back home. We head to Minoh Falls. 

Stay either by there or in Kobe. One ryokan stay would be nice since I've always wanted to experience it.

**DAY 11**: Explore Kobe for the day. Nunobiki Ropeway, Carpentry Museum.  Food around Sannomiya. Look into sake district if we have time (and energy).

Travel to Nagoya and check in.

**DAY 12**: Explore Nagoya, and try their food such as miso katsu and hitsumabushi. Nagoya Castle or Osu Kannon (Osu would be nostalgic for me). If we can, hit up the Toyota or Science Museum.

**DAY 13**: Ghibli Park or any other place we missed out on exploring, since I see only standard tickets are left.

Head out to Yokohama.

**DAY 14**: Walk along the Yokohama Bay to Chinatown.

**DAY 15**: Check out Sankeien Garden.

Tokyo Airport to fly home in the late afternoon.

  
Let me know if this seems doable. I'm trying to keep things mostly focused in specific areas, but I'll likely still have to trim it down. If you guys feel we're moving to too many stops to enjoy anything towards the end, I'd love to hear suggestions to make the most of the last few days!",https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1ndu8om/advice_on_1015_day_itinerary_for_november/,"How are you getting from Gotemba to Gora?

1ndw9zv,"Review my itinerary - 03.10.2025 to 17.10.2025 - Tokyo, Kyoto, Osaka - First timer","Hi

Quick introduction - I am a 26M, not a huge anime/manga fan visiting japan for the first time for its culture and heritage. I am big on art/museums and cultural exploration. I have been lurking for a while in this sub, looking at itineraries made by fellow travellers. A lot of them were packed and redditors recommended to dial it down. With those posts in mind, I designed my itinerary with sufficient gaps. However, my worry is if I have under-planned my whole trip.

Oct 03 - land at narita around 7:40AM and head to my friend's place for stay. Will head to Asakusa and roam the neighbourhood

Oct 04 - Teamlabs borderless, shibuya area

Oct 05 - Shinkansen ride to Kyoto, head to Himeji castle and art museum in Himeji if time permits (or should I skip the museum and head back to kyoto?)

Oct 06 -  Fushimi Inari Taisha, waterfall and surroundings (Am I allotting too much time for this one shrine - It is high on my bucketlist and I intend to spend a lot of time but will I need an entire day, or can I squeeze in another nearby spot?)

Oct 07 -Arashiyama bamboo grove, monkey park, Kinkaku - ji and Daitoku - ji if I have the time

Oct 08 - Head to USJ Osaka early morning via shinkansen, return back to kyoto on the same day (I am heading to USJ on oct 08 to skip the long weekend crowd. Tickets are also costlier on oct 10. I have a hotel booking from oct 05 to oct 09, hence I am doing this, I would have preferred to take another day of stay in Osaka)

Oct 09 - Leave for osaka early morning and check in. Head to osaka aquarium, Minami area in the evening

Oct 10 - Osaka castle and Museum of history, take an overnight bus/sunset train to tokyo

Oct 11 to 13 - Atami/Hakone/Fujikawaguchiko (wherever my friend takes me lol)

Oct 14 - Disneysea

Oct 15 - Day trip to Kamakura (If I am in tokyo I will visit Sumida Hokusai museum and samurai museum)

Oct 16 - Day trip to Nikko 

Oct 17 - Teamlabs planets morning slot, taking the last flight back home in the night.

Most of Nishiki Market is closed by 6pm, so your plan for the evening the day before won't work anyway. Spend the morning and afternoon of 11/5 around Nishiki Market, or the new Kyoto Teamlabs, or around Gion/Higashiyama, then head to Tokyo and spend the evening there.",

Thank you very much to the whole community. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1ndgyv6/our_first_japan_trip_oct_25_14_nights_thank_you/,"Sports Day is basically another day of the weekend. You'll see more locals hanging around in popular spots.


Do YOU want to go to Osaka? If you do, what do you want to do there? I doubt you do since you didn't include it but nobody else can answer that.


If Fuji is not visible go to Nikko. Bear in mind that you don't need to go to Shinjiku specifically. Buses for Kawaguchiko also depart from Shibuya, Ikebukuro and Tokyo stations.","Seems fine. Not too packed, which is good, because I guarantee you, you will not be bored in the larger cities.

As for Osaka... Ehh, honestly, I'd skip it. The thing with Osaka is that, besides the food culture and the Dotonbori area, it's kinda like Tokyo, which you are already visiting anyway. Osaka doesn't really have cultural sightseeing spots like Kyoto does. Osaka is a nice place to stay if you want to do lots of daytrips to neighbouring cities and places (Himeji, Kobe, Koya-san or even Hiroshima), but you're visiting lots of places already. Best not too overstuff it :)

You could always visit Osaka from late afternoon till the evening to experience Dotonbori (do be careful not to miss your last train back to Kyoto!)","This seems sensible. Most of your days are are slow paced, except the very last one which would have you racing around.

I much prefer Osaka to Kyoto, but I‚Äôd suggest that you look into what you‚Äôd do there.","I would skip a day in Osaka and go to Yokohama for Day 9 to 10, either that or an extra day in Tokyo for day trips to Yokohama or Kamakura/Enoshima/Nikko.",

1. Give yourself some space and time to enjoy or veer off a plan, unless this is how you always travel and it so apologies.
2. Bic and Yodobashi are pretty much the same, no real need for both IMO, also line photography here.",Don‚Äôt skip out on Ikebukuro! Sunshine city mall has the best and biggest(?)

1ncs107,2 week rough itinerary,"Hi everyone! longtime lurker, finally it‚Äòs my turn to ask for recommendations and itinerary critique :) we‚Äòre flying in a week, wooo!

First off: We take it slowly, we‚Äòre well aware we could squeeze in much more, but we don‚Äòt want to. It‚Äòs our only holidays this year so we wanna enjoy it and not rush it. That being said, we‚Äòre still overwhelmed and I‚Äòve saved like 80 restaurants already, haha. And here we are: these are our four main interests in this holiday: food (flexible budget), culture, photography, light shopping. 

I‚Äòm looking for recommendations for additions on our route, photospots (I‚Äôm not big on insta, more personal streetphotos) and maybe one or two specific things regarding food/shopping in the areas we‚Äòre already in anyway.


##Hiroshima: 
**day1 **- arrival Hiroshima - explore surroundings
**day2** - exploring and history tour, *recommendations? for a tourguide*
**day3 **- daytrip to one of the close by islands (that tori gate island probably)

**day4 **- transfer to Kyoto via Himeji Castle (train & castle entry already bought), explore surroundings if hotel in Kyoto

##Kyoto: 
**day5** - get up before sunrise to Senbon Torii Gates. 
*? eat lunch around there or better somewhere further away? since we‚Äòre already South of the city center, Castle Fushini and/or Kizakura Kappa Sake Museum?*
**day6 **- go east, direction Otagi Nenbutsuji/Adashino Nenbutsuji/Gjoji temples. 
*? Does this take the whole day?*
**day7 **- exploring the city, go shopping, checking out some restaurants & markets.

**day8 **- transfer to Tokyo, 
*? worth to stop (where?!?) to see Mt Fuji in September? *

##Tokyo - staying close Ueno station
**day9 **- explore Asakusa & Ueno Park 
**day10** - early rise for Toyosu Tuna auction *(no tour, okay?)*, later teamlab planets bc close by, afternoon walking around Ebisu and go shopping for kitchenware at The Harvest General Store. 
*? Restaurant rec‚Äòs in Ebisu?*
**day11 **- explore Ginza & emperors palace 
*? reservations neccesary? is a tour worth it?* maybe evening walk around Shibuya
**day12 **- explore Shibuya & Shinjuku, shopping
*? final evening meal near Ueno, any recommendations?* We could splurge, but it‚Äòs necessary, just a fab meal for two for 1-3h. I‚Äòve saved so far Tonkatsu Tonpachitel & Niki no Kashi, Ishibashi would be doable as well.
**day13 **- flying home :-(

apart from the questions already asked. 
I‚Äòve saved a couple restaurants around Iidabashi. *Worth the detour on one of the daS apart from the restaurants?*

We decided for Ubigi as an eSim (saily close followup), made accounts on goTaxi, bought traintickets through smartex, downloaded Suica, will probably book a tour with BeBros if they answer my request, may be interested in photography workshop but don‚Äòt see space to squeeze it in as of now.

What do you guys think?
thank you wholeheartedly already for your feedback.",https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1ncs107/2_week_rough_itinerary/,"Here‚Äôs a 20% off code for Ubigi if you need: YHG3SDUR

1nd0s7b,8-Day Golden Route + Hiroshima Wrestling Show Itinerary ‚Äì Advice Wanted (Traveling with my Dad),"Hi all! üëã (I used AI to plan so far but I want real advice)

I‚Äôll be in Japan this December with my dad (his first time, my second ‚Äî I only did Tokyo last time). I already have my flights booked in/out of Narita, but I‚Äôm very flexible with the order of things. The only fixed plan is Hiroshima on Dec 8 because I‚Äôm going to an NJPW show at Sun Plaza Hall.

I‚Äôm looking for advice/tips on:

Whether my order of cities makes sense (avoiding too much backtracking if possible).

If the JR Pass is worth it in my case ‚Äî last time I just had a Tokyo Subway Pass and it was enough, but I‚Äôve heard JR isn‚Äôt always a good deal anymore.

Alternative Hiroshima ideas that aren‚Äôt just the heavy WWII history (I respect it, but not as interested this trip).

Ways to make it more ‚Äúexperience-heavy‚Äù (temples, old Japan, maybe a samurai-related thing, some kind of traditional music/theater) instead of just shopping.

Any tips for avoiding crowds on the Golden Route.

Budget-friendly tweaks.


Here‚Äôs my rough itinerary (trying to balance the Golden Route highlights with efficiency):

Evening: traditional dinner in Kyoto.
Overnight: Kyoto


üïäÔ∏è Day 4: Monday, Dec 8 ‚Äì Hiroshima (Show Night)

Morning: Train to Hiroshima.

Daytime: Peace Park + Okonomiyaki.

üõ´ Day 8: Friday, Dec 12 ‚Äì Departure

---

üí° Extra context:

I value experiences over shopping but wouldn‚Äôt mind a tiny bit of shopping sprinkled in.

This trip is a ‚Äúmake up for last time‚Äù (since I only did Tokyo before).

Budget-friendly is good ‚Äî but I want to prioritize memorable things over pure savings.

Open to interesting alternatives if there are less touristy but still cool options along the route.


Thanks in advance! üôè Any tweaks, efficiency tips, or experience suggestions would be amazing.
",https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1nd0s7b/8day_golden_route_hiroshima_wrestling_show/,"I did two nights in Hiroshima, and when taking the shinkansen from Osaka to Hiroshima, I stopped at Himeji Castle, which is walking distance from the train stop, and is quite worth it. You can literally see it the moment you step outside.

On the full day in Hiroshima, I took the ferry to Itsukishima Shrine, which, like most UNESCO Heritage sites, is a must-see. I went there first thing, got to stand next to the gate when the tide was out, and then I took the ropeway up the mountain, where you can get the best view of the inland sea, and it was breathtaking. It isn't strictly necessary, but once up there, you can hike to a different observatory, which I did. By the time I went back down, before the sun had set, the tide had already come back in, and I did a second go of the shrine, which was an entirely different experience. I can't imagine going to Hiroshima, and *not* seeing this shrine, or getting a good look at the inland sea. After the sunset, I went and got okonomiyaki at Nagataya, a famous place right by the Atomic Dome. It was about a 45-minute wait, and absolutely worth it.

The next morning, I did the Peace Museum (which was mobbed), and then took the train to Takayama. The museum does not require a lot of time, maybe 90 minutes iirc. 

I was in Japan for a month, and Hiroshima might've been the highlight of the whole trip. Don't sleep on it.

As for the JR pass, I did a lot of traveling that month (Tokyo, to Kyoto, to Osaka, to Hiroshima, to Takayama, to Kanazawa, and back to Tokyo), and it was just a trip or two shy of being worthwhile. It's just not a great deal anymore.","Your plan looks great for a first Golden Route trip with your dad! Day 3 in Kyoto will be quite packed (Fushimi Inari, Kinkaku-ji, Kiyomizu-dera, and Gion all in one day is ambitious), so maybe just focus on 2‚Äì3 spots that interest you most. If you want more ‚Äúexperience-heavy‚Äù activities, Kyoto has great tea ceremony or kimono rental experiences around Gion/Kiyomizu area, which could be fun with your dad. For Hiroshima, aside from Peace Park, you could enjoy Miyajima Island (Itsukushima Shrine and the ropeway up Mt. Misen) ‚Äî it‚Äôs beautiful and less heavy compared to the WWII sites.","You got it backwards.

If you want to go to Kobe stop there on your way from Hiroshima to Osaka. And you should stop at Himeji first and visit the castle, so you can skip Osaka castle. Also, you can eat Kobe beef anywhere in Japan.

Do Nara from Osaka.

Hiroshima> Mitaki-dera, Koganeyama Park, Mazda Museum tour, Ujina Island, Tram view deck.

You can buy Imabari towels at almost any souvenir shop in Shikoku.

Edit: want to add, it‚Äôs a good call to skip the Nagoro scarecrow village. Fascinating as it is, it is VERY hard to get to. From the highway it‚Äôs probably over an hour of slow, careful driving on one-way, zig-zagging mountain roads.",

",https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1nd2ew7/travel_itinerary_tohokuthoughts/,"Wait, you are going to Sapporo and Yoichi, but not Otaru?!?","Book a tour for Yoichi Distillery if you can. With a guided tour, you get to see the production area, which is not available to walk-ins. The tour is conducted in Japanese, but there's audio guide to download into your phone if I remember correctly.
    
I know a lot of people like to point out the ""must-sees"" they think you shouldn‚Äôt miss, but honestly, I‚Äôd say just prioritize what you enjoy. The Music Box Museum and Venezia Museum at the shopping street can be interesting if that‚Äôs your kind of thing. If you‚Äôre passing through Otaru on the way to Yoichi, the old Temiya railway line (for quick photos) and the canal is just a short walk away.

1ncging,Shikoku + Okayama Itinerary Check (October 2026),"Hello! My mum (62F) and I (35F) are planning a trip to Shikoku and Okayama in October 2026. I used to live in Japan but I spent most of my time in Chubu and Kanto, so this is the first time I'll be going to Shikoku.

We'll definitely be renting a car so we're aware that there'll be quite a bit of driving involved.

My main aims are seeing 5 out of the 12 existing castles, so hitting most of these places will be essential, plus seeing as many cats as I can (I've left out most of the cat attractions from the itinerary for now as they are on the way to most places). However, I don't want the trip to be too full on as my mum is getting older and I just want her to have a great time (she doesn't care too much about what we do).

Specifically, I'd like to ask for feedback and suggestions, such as:  
\- Are there any days that are too packed or under-utilised?  
\- Hotel and restaurant/cafe suggestions (I have many picked out but suggestions would be great)  
\- Any must-dos I've missed?  
\- Anything else you'd like to add :)

Thank you in advance!",https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1ncging/shikoku_okayama_itinerary_check_october_2026/,"If these are not on your list I recommend them: 

\- Takaya Shrine 2800 Takayacho, Kanonji, Kagawa 768-0002, Japan it's literally known as the torii in the sky extremely beautiful

\- Shimonada Station, since you're driving along Ozu you'll probably pass this but it's the 2nd closest train station to the ocean in Japan 

\- The Gohanyasan 536‚Äï1 Tamanoe, Saijo, Ehime 799-1363, Japan, we passed by this place by chance while driving and it's such a hole in the wall gem run by this old couple the portions are great and prices are unbeatable

\- walk through Kurashiki Bikan Historical Quarter towards Denim streets its filled with shops and snack places. I got myself a cute denim wallet, gifts from the miffy x kurashiki shop, and i regretfully did not get the ""denim ice cream"" which is just blue ice cream

\- if you're driving from takamatsu to okayama i recommend Washuzan 2nd Observation Deck, it overs amazing views at the top of the ocean and bridge and a special lucario manhole cover if you like pokemon","Regarding Ozu, aren‚Äôt you planning on visiting the castle? Garyu Sanso offers a tea ceremony  on Sundays and national holidays until October, maybe this is something that you could look for. I went to Ozu with the Iyonada Monogatari train (super lovely btw), and it stopped briefly at the Shimonada station, with a car it would be really nice to pay a visit.

Matsuyama is my favorite city from my last Japan trip. Other than your sites I went to Ishite-ji and the Bansuiso, a classical French-style manor, but they are skippable in a short timespan tbh. Mikan juice and Tai Meshi are the must-drink and eat. Have a nice trip!","Even if your mother is not an onsen person the Dogo Onsen building is quite striking especially at night and along with the arcade area and clock it's a pretty great area to explore. If you're going to Ozu make sure to visit Uchiko as well, it's a charming little town with many historical architecture. While you're at Kagawa pref and Takamatsu try as many udons as possible, the Prefecture is known for that. Mugizo was great. And try to visit Ritsurin Garden, it isn't too large but well maintained and memorable. I don't think you have to spend that much time at Kurashiki, it is charming and quaint but not that big. Why not head to Kurashiki early after Marugame castle and explore the town on day 10? That way you have time to visit Korakuen and Okayama Castle later.",,
1ncacjw,3-4 day Tokyo Itinerary Feedback,"Hi, we‚Äôre a couple in our late 20s visiting Japan 9/10-9/14 on the way back from another international trip. We‚Äôre staying in Asakusa.

I‚Äôve worked with chat gpt to come up with an itinerary that seems like it does this. Let me know what you think! Thanks!

Edit: one feedback I got from r/japantraveltips was the shinjuku back/forth to drop off shoppings on the 12th was better replaced with using coin lockers at the shinjuku station and staying at shinjuku area the full day instead.

1nce8n0,12D 11N Hokkaido Itinerary,"Hi everyone,

We‚Äôre a family of 4 (2 adults, 2 kids aged 4 & 5) planning a self-drive trip to Hokkaido from 5‚Äì16 Nov. Both of us can drive, so we‚Äôll be renting a car. I‚Äôd love advice on whether this itinerary makes sense for the season and if it‚Äôs manageable with young kids and two drivers. 

Draft Itinerary (12D11N)

Day 1‚Äì2: Sapporo (flying in from Singapore)
	‚Ä¢	Odori Park & TV Tower
	‚Ä¢	Shiroi Koibito Chocolate Factory
	‚Ä¢	Sapporo Science Center

Day 3‚Äì4: Otaru (1h drive)
	‚Ä¢	Otaru Canal & Music Box Museum - is the Music Box Museum worth a visit or we should pass it up?
	‚Ä¢	LeTAO Cheesecake
	‚Ä¢	Otaru Aquarium

Day 5‚Äì6: Asahikawa & Biei (2.5h drive)
	‚Ä¢	Asahiyama Zoo 
	‚Ä¢	Biei Blue Pond

Day 7‚Äì8: Furano / Tomamu
	‚Ä¢	Ningle Terrace (craft village)
	‚Ä¢	Farm Tomita greenhouses & lavender soft serve
	‚Ä¢	Stay at Hoshino Resorts Tomamu

Day 9‚Äì10: Noboribetsu / Lake Toya (3‚Äì4h drive)
	‚Ä¢	Noboribetsu Date Jidaimura
	‚Ä¢	Jigokudani Hell Valley (geothermal walks)
	‚Ä¢	Stay at Lake Toya onsen

Day 11‚Äì12: Back to Sapporo / CTS Airport
	‚Ä¢	Mitsui Outlet Park Kitahiroshima
	‚Ä¢	Moerenuma Park

As my husband and I haven‚Äôt been to Hokkaido before, we have a few hesitations whether we are too ambitious and will tire ourselves out with just two drivers. Is this too ambitious for our kids, they nap well during long drives and can be easily bribed with snacks so that should work in our favour. 

Would you suggest cutting one region (e.g. Furano/Tomamu vs. Noboribetsu/Lake Toya) to slow down the pace? Is there any particular areas which we should spend more days in, to relax and slow down our pace. 

Any must-visit child-friendly attractions we‚Äôre missing? We are interested in nature. 

Tips for handling early winter driving conditions in Hokkaido? We come from Singapore so more used to urban driving. I also read that car rental places aren‚Äôt friendly to English speakers, is there any recommended car rental that provide children car-seats? Thank you!
",https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1nce8n0/12d_11n_hokkaido_itinerary/,"Just be warned you may see snow in November in Hokkaido so take your time if it's your first time driving in the snow.

In Otaru, maybe visit the City Museum which has a bunch of old trains.

An in-between stop between Tomamu and Noboribetsu would be Tomakomai and the Technology Center there is a kid friendly museum.

That Tomamu-Noboribetsu seems like a stretch and the Bear Park was actually depressing to me as an adult. You will probably have to wake up and get moving really early to do everything you have planned there. I've done everything you planned in a day but I had to take the very first train out of Sapporo to ensure I did everything. You could stay at a hot springs in Noboribetsu instead of Lake Toya

I really can't recommend anything kid friendly east of Sapporo since I haven't done anything kid friendly in Asahikawa personally (except the ice festival) but I have wanted to do the Northern Horse Park.

When I have rented cars in Japan, they tend to get an English speaker on a phone to explain everything to you. Not sure about car seats.","Right in front of the aquarium, there‚Äôs a restaurant where they grill fish at the entrance‚Äîyou might want to include it in your itinerary.  
Last time, I spent eight days traveling from Chitose > Noboribetsu > Hakodate > Matsumae Castle > Otaru > Sapporo. I‚Äôd recommend planning your driving route in a circular loop, as it makes the trip feel more relaxed.  
The stretch from Furano to Noboribetsu might be the most challenging part of your drive.",,,

I'm aware the 'Autumn Foliage Report' came out earlier saying peak autumn colors is going to basically be December 31st - Kind of a bummer, but all the super cool autumn spots (Nikko, Tokyo parks, etc) are still quite scenic without being orange, so I'm not too worried about it

1nc2n30,2 Day Kyoto Itinerary Help,"Hi everyone,

I made a 2 day itinerary in Kyoto and just wanted some opinions to optimize time and travel between places.

Monday, Oct. 6 (Arashiyama):
-8AM: put names down in Steak Otsuka
-Go to Arashiyama bamboo forest before crowds form
-Sogenchi Teien and Okochi Sanso Garden
-Kinkaku-ji temple
-hopefully end before 5pm to explore more of downtown Kyoto and hit some spots scheduled for the next day.

Tuesday, Oct.7 (Kiyomizu-dera and Nijo Castle):
-6AM: Kiyomizu-dera 

-walk through Ninenzaka, Sannenzaka. Any recommendations for particular shops to stop by through here? Is Chawanzaka worth walking through? Thinking about doing a tea ceremony with Maikoya here.
 
-then Nijo castle and Samurai ninja museum in that order due to closing times.

-I have Ginkakuji and Fushimi Inari Taisha listed for this day as well but not sure where to place them or if they‚Äôre worth going to since they‚Äôre both out of the way. I saw Fushimi Inari is open 24 hours so i‚Äôd be interested in going at a time when there would be less people and wondering when the crowds die down here.

Please let me know what you think of this itinerary in terms of what is better to do earlier in the day, which sites to prioritize, food recommendations nearby, etc. Would appreciate any input! Thanks!

",https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1nc2n30/2_day_kyoto_itinerary_help/,Looks like a pretty busy itinerary but definitely doable,"I can't advise from first hand experience, but I'm also planning my trip. From everything I've seen, I personally think Fushimi Inari Taisha would be worth it. It definitely depends on your interests and priorities, as it's more of a hike. But as I understand, crowds die down quite a bit as you go further in, and there is so much to see there. (There's even a bamboo forest area in there :D). 

I'm in Kyoto for 3 days, and setting aside 4 hours to go through as much as we can. But even if my stay was shorter, I'd drop Arashiyama before Fushimi Inari Taisha. 
Again, just my take for my own itinerary. 

I hope you have a great trip :)","The only way to optimize travel between places in Kyoto is taking a taxi since trains/metro don't get you everywhere and buses are packed and take a long time.

If something is worth it is up to you and what you like. Those places are famous for a reason. Like everything else, Fushimi Inari has less people really early or late in the day. Though since it's basically a long hike with endless stairs you might the light of day.","Guys take the Torroko Scenic Train from Kameoka, (Umahori Station, Torroko Kameoka) to Arshiyama Forest. I highly recommend it",

You could fly from Tokyo to either but if you factor in the travel time and effort of going to a Tokyo airport, the train is probably easier. If you like gardens, Korakuen in Okayama was a highlight on our last trip. You could hit that on the way in or out of Okayama.",Takamatsu to Tokyo flight is very easy. There are airport buses that will take you straight there from Takamatsu station (across the street from the Naoshima ferry terminal). The airport itself is small and almost never too busy.

These are very small towns that don't even have konbini. There are souvenir shops that have some foodstuffs. 

That's a bummer you don't have the leeway to do the Magome-Tsumago hike, if you like nature and hiking at all, it's a little gem (no, other sections are not just as beautiful). But yeah, it just doesn't fit, with building wait time into your travel and how early things shut down. It took me 3 hrs but I'm a little slow, I like to meander.

Japanese people use Tabelog for restaurant reviews, but Google Maps can give decent enough results.

Question 1 : You should go to Nikko as early as possible. If you go toward the lake as the priority, then keep the bridge and the temple/shrine for the afternoon if you have time as about everything close at 5pm, so after that about the only thing you would do is be on your way to Tokyo.

Note that Kawaguchiko-Hiroshima can be closer to 6-7hours.

Question 2 : Not really sure what you mean by the Osaka day trip question. Really not clear.

Day 9, is your priority purely the autumn leaf? Going to Nara to see the park and the temple like Todai-ji is a valid option at all time of the year. Obviously Universal Studio is also an option, really depend on your priority.

If you are scared to feel what people sometimes call temple fatigue when you find that most temples and shrines look about the same, then just plan alternatives. And it might also not happen. I personally love visiting temple and shrines and they are always on my things to see even after 10 trips, but yes for other people after 2 it's all the same.","The itinerary does not make sense geographically. Go from Kawaguchiko to Kyoto (or Osaka) in order to not waste half the day just traveling to Hiroshima. Then do Hiroshima - Osaka (or Kyoto) - Tokyo. Also, you don't have to backtrack to Tokyo. You have to take a bus from Kawaguchiko to Mishima station and take the shinkansen for Kyoto.


Day 2- you're missing Toshogu, one of the most beautiful and possibly important shrines in the country.

(thanks in advance for looking it over)

I'm giong to Japan, with the below itineary - please feel free to review and let me know if you have any suggestions:

Oct 8/9: Leaving Toronto on Oct 8 and landing in Narita on Oct 9 at 3:45PM.

Oct 9: Land in Narita and take the Narita Express -> Shinkansen to Sendai 

Oct 10: Sendai to Yamadera Temple first thing in the morning, head to Zao Onsen area for a few hours, then head back to Yamagata Station area for casual browsing and head back to Sendai

Oct 11: Exploring Sendai (Loople bus ticket and browsing the City - food recommendations will be greatly appreciated!)

Oct 12: Sendai to Matsushima Bay, check out Shiogoma fish market, Zuiganji Temple, Entsuin, Kanrantei Tea House, and other casual browsing, then back to Sendai

Oct 13: Sendai to Aomori in the morning by train, check out Nebuta Museum, A-Factory (other recommendations would also be appreciated - couldn't find much else)

Oct 14: Aomori to Hakodate in the morning by train, check out Kanemori, Hachiman-Zaka, Orthodox church, Motomachi, and Mt. Hakodate Observatory. For food, Lucky Pierrot (just to try)

Oct 15: Hakodate morning market then train from Hakodate to Noboribetsu, staying at the Dai-ichi Takimotokan for the day.

Oct 16: Hakodate to Sapporo, check out Beer Museum, explore the City like TV tower, Suskino St, Slowboat, Tanukikoji Street, Shiroi Koibito Park

Oct 17: Stay in Sapporo - check out Maruyama Park, Hokkaido Jingu, Mt. Okura Ski Jump and Mt. Moiwa

Oct 18: Sapporo to Otaru in the morning, checking out the canal, Sakaimachi, Kitaichi Glass Otaru, Otaru Sushi Restaurant Street and LeTAO

Oct 19: Not sure what to do this day but leaning towards taking a small onsen trip somewhere.

Oct 20: CTS to NRT flight at 10:25AM, landing at 12:05PM, then flight back to Toronto at 4:50PM. (I think this is more than enough buffer between two flights - booked separately).

I tried to balance out busy days and non-busy days as much as possible but feel free to provide any tips/feedback! Thank you so much in advance.

We are planning to do an Omakase sushi or tempura one of the nights in Kyoto or Tokyo and still need to plan that. We also need to make a list of the the stores/sites we want to visit during our Tokyo days, but we know the general neighbourhoods we want to hit up. 


TOKYO 2 nights 

KYOTO 4 nights

NARAI 1 night

MATSUMOTO 1 night

FUJI 1 night

TOKYO 4 nights


Day 1 - Tokyo: arrive at NRT around 4 pm, get to hotel in Shinjuku area and check in.


Day 2 - Tokyo: full day in Tokyo. Going to stick around the Shinjuku/Shibuya areas. JINS for new glasses, some shopping, 11 am reservation at FFIX pop up cafe. We might have friends coming to see us this day so we‚Äôre leaving it open for now.


Day 3 - Kyoto: Shinkansen to Kyoto around 10 or 11 am. We can check in to our hotel at 4, but we‚Äôre going to see if we can check in early. Yokai parade at TOEI park at 6:00 pm.


Day 4 - Kyoto: planning to wake up early and check out shrines on the east side of Kyoto. We still need to map our route. I want to spend the morning collecting different ceramic omikuji from the shrines. After lunch we will do some shopping and maybe check out the manga museum. *maybe omakase dinner this night


Day 5 - Kyoto: planning to wake up early and take transit to Takao. We are going to walk from Takao to Arashiyama along the Kiyotaki river. We have a tentative lunch booked at Arashiyama itsukichaya at 2:00 pm but we‚Äôre willing to cancel this if it‚Äôll be too rushed. GEAR theatre at 7:00 pm. 


Day 6 - Kyoto: Misc. day/rest day/laundry. We might go to the Golden Pavillion in the morning. Maybe rent bikes if it‚Äôs a nice day. We need to go to bed early. Are there any good ropeways in Kyoto? We‚Äôd be interested in going on one of these if there are any recommendations! 


Day 7 - Travel/Hike/Narai: we are waking up early to travel from Kyoto to Yabuhara. Planning to get to Yabuhara around lunch time and then hike from Yabuhara to Narai on the Nakasendo trail via the Torii pass. We‚Äôre staying at a Minshuku in Narai that includes a kaiseki dinner.


Day 8 - Hike/Matsumoto: this will be day 2 of our Nakasendo trail hike. We‚Äôre planning to train from Narai to Nagiso, walk from Nagiso to Magome and then catch the bus to Nakatsugawa. From there we will train to Matsumoto where we are staying at Asama Onsen for 1 night.


Day 9 - Fuji: wake up fairly early and taxi to Matsumoto station, walk to see Matsumoto castle and Nawate shopping street, then take a train to Fujiyoshida at 10:00 am. Arrive in Fuji around 1:00 pm. We‚Äôre staying at Kaneyamaen for the night which includes kaiseki dinner, onsen, etc.


Day 10 - Fuji/Tokyo: we are going to spend the morning and early afternoon exploring Fuji and go up to Arakirayama Sengen Park to get good views. We might rent bikes and bike around. Train back to Tokyo in the afternoon. Staying in either Akihabara or Asakusa for the next 4 nights (I have 2 hotels booked and need to decide!). 


Day 11 - Tokyo: planning to explore the Central/East side neighbourhoods: Akihabara, Asakusa, Ueno. Maybe go to Chiyoda City and the Imperial Palace if we have time. *maybe omakase dinner on this night


Day 12 - Tokyo: planning to do the North/West neighbourhoods on this day: Ikebukuro, Nagano Broadway, Itabashi. Maybe revisit Shinjuku/Shibuya if there‚Äôs things we missed the first time around. *waiting to see if we can get Ghibli museum tickets for this day or day 13 so we maybe swap these two days around.


Day 13 - Tokyo: East/South neighbourhoods: Solomachi/Skytree area, Gundam Base, maybe go to Chiyoda City/Imperial Palace if we don‚Äôt get there on day 11. *maybe omakase dinner on this night 


Day 14 - Tokyo/fly home: Last minute shopping etc in the morning.

* I have a chronic illness that impacts my energy levels and will be renting a power wheelchair to have as back-up (can still handle a little walking on bad days though). I realize that certain locations on the itinerary are not wheelchair-friendly, so my thinking is that if, say, Day 6 ends up being such that I can‚Äôt handle a whole day on foot, I can switch it with, say, Day 7, and if I‚Äôm still not well enough then, I‚Äôll have to just come up with a different plan. **Wheelchair-accessible alternatives to the inaccessible places would be wonderful!**
* Nothing is booked after Day 5, so Days 6-9 can be shuffled around.
* We‚Äôre very open to using taxis.
* With the exception of Harukor, we aren‚Äôt planning for specific restaurants. I have been pinning some wheelchair-accessible ones on Google Maps just in case. **Recommendations for those are appreciated too.**
* I‚Äôm still not sure how much time to budget for the below shrines and temples. I want to take in the scenery, read any informational signs, and get goshuin without feeling rushed. I‚Äôve heard that it really varies; I‚Äôve also heard that 1-1.5 hrs per shrine/temple is best. **I‚Äôd especially love to hear about this from anyone who‚Äôs visited the ones in my itinerary.**
* Bonus points for anyone who can point me to specific places in these areas that sell Hello Kitty or Kewpie gotochi (or any regional trinkets of that sort).

**Day 1**

10:25 Arrive at Komatsu Airport; forward luggage to hotel

* **Question:** Does anyone know how long it might take to get through immigration, set up luggage forwarding, etc.? I know it can take a long time at Narita but can't find any info on international arrivals in Komatsu (our route is YVR > TPE > KMQ).

Taxi or bus to Uhashi Shrine

If I can get there before they close, Hiyoshi Shrine and/or Suamakumano Shrine

Chaku Chaku Chaku (cheap thrift store)

Train to Kanazawa

**Day 2**

Morning (starting at 7?): Kanazawa Castle Park, maybe Kenroku-en

Lunch: Omicho Market

After lunch: split up. I want to tackle at least one of Oyama Shrine, Kanazawa Shrine, and Ishiura Shrine.

* **Question:** For someone who wants to take it all in and also get goshuin, how many (or which ones) out of those shrines are realistic for \~3 hours?

16:00 Reunite; Ishikawa Prefectural Museum of Art OR Nagamachi (Nomura-ke)

**Day 3**

Split up

9:00 Joganji (Mikawa); might visit nearby Fujitsuka Shrine or explore area

Train back to Kanazawa; Yasue Hachimangu

After lunch: taxi to Haseyama Kannon-in; Higashi Chaya

16:00 Reunite; Ishikawa Prefectural Museum of Art OR Nagamachi, whichever was not visited the day prior

**Day 4 - Shirakawa-go day trip**

8:10 Nohi Bus to Shirakawa-go (booked)

9:25 Arrive in Shirakawa-go

* Gassho Zukuri Minka-en, eat, wander

15:10 Bus departs Shirakawa-go (booked)

16:35 Bus arrives in Kanazawa

Time/energy permitting: thrifting at Off House

Night: Kenroku-en

**Day 5**

8:09 Shinkansen to Tokyo

10:37 Arrive at Tokyo Station; drop off luggage and (if feeling well) wheelchair at hotel next to station

Lunch nearby or at Azabudai Hills

13:00 - 13:30 entry to teamLab Borderless (already booked, with tea)

16:30? Leave for Harukor to arrive a bit early for 17:00 open and ensure seats

Post-dinner: explore Shinjuku? (Neither of us are big on drinking/nightlife.) Or perhaps go down to Shibuya?

**Day 6**

9:30 Yushima Seido

Whenever we‚Äôre done there: Akihabara

* Specific targets: Mandarake, Suruga-ya, Radio Kaikan, Earl‚Äôs Favorite, 2k540 Aki-Oka Artisan
* Basically reserving this day for exploring Akihabara, because I am a weeb who likes to shop.

**Day 7**

*Trying to plan a more or less wheelchair-friendly day here, because I might be totally shot by this point.*

7:30 Senso-ji, Asakusa Shrine, Hikan Inari Shrine

* **Question:** Considering that this means leaving the hotel during rush hour, would taking a taxi be any better than public transit (in this case, the Ginza Line)?

Nakamise-dori and neighbouring shopping streets

After lunch: Tokyo National Museum

Time permitting: temples/shrines in Ueno Park e.g. Shinobazu no Ike Benten-do - not wheelchair-friendly?

After dinner: ideally, Ginza for Ito-ya and ancora (we have to fit those in somewhere, my dad will not accept otherwise)

**Day 8 - Kamakura/Yokohama day trip**

8:00 Hasedera; Kannon Museum; Kotoku-in; Retro Games Store B-Dash; Goryo Shrine

* **Question:** I know that last one gets crowded, but I‚Äôm not sure how much of that is for the shrine itself (specific hours?) vs. the train track photo op (anytime?). Does it matter what time of day we go there if we want less of a crowd?

Lunch; shop around Kamakura Station before heading to Yokohama

If we arrive in time: Hikawa Maru

Chinatown

* Specific targets: Goku Tea House, Kuan Ti Miao

Other options: Red Brick Warehouse, World Porters, Marine Tower?

**Day 9**

10:00 Snoopy Museum

After lunch: Shibuya, if we didn‚Äôt get there on Day 5 (mostly for the Capcom and Nintendo stores at Shibuya Parco - not sure how much shopping I‚Äôll do there otherwise because I‚Äôm not built for Japanese clothes lmao)

Any ‚Äúmusts‚Äù we didn‚Äôt get to previously

* If there are none, then Nakano Broadway?

**Day 10**

17:25 flight from Narita Airport

* Debating what time to leave for the airport via Narita Express. I‚Äôm not keen on trying to cram more sightseeing in just in case something goes sideways, but it is a later flight. That said, I definitely want to at least visit the Pokemon store for the exclusive Pikachus.

Thank you to anyone who took the time to read all this!",https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1nbp784/sep_oct_itinerary_kanazawatokyo_with_day_trips/,"Day 2: 

If you speed through the 3 shrines yeah under 3 hours is possible, when I went in Feb there wasn't any lines in Kanazawa shrine/park nor oyama shrine. I'm not sure if you should split one half of Kanazawa castle park in the morning and then return to it to go to Kanazawa shrine in the afternoon, i'd recommend mapping out the route you'll walk/bus to prevent time wasted. I also absolutely hated the local bus system in Kanazawa, it's routes were confusing and you can't use suica/ioca to pay so i recommend getting their day passes. 

Day 4: 

For Kenroku En at night just beware even though it seems like it's open 247 it's actually not...the ticketing office closes at like 5 so when we went last time at 7pm there was no way in...

Day 7: 

I think this is a LOT. Ueno and Asakusa together may be do-able but trekking across the city to Ginza after being out since 7:30am is concerning, especially because you can easily spend an entire 8 hour day just in Ginza alone. I can break down in detail why I recommend against this if you're interested. Also, taxi to Asakusa will be more comfortable, not in terms of time but rather to not be shoulder-to-shoulder with the commuters. 

Day 8: 

Kotoku-in and the famous train track cross will always be busy, particularly in the afternoon. Expect crowds, with the least busy being early in the morning at like 8am. Also for the train tracks, there is not a lot of space for people to take photos so even just 10 or so people can crowd the area real bad. 

In Yokohama, if you head straight toward Hikawa Maru it's quite a convenient route because you directly go from Kamakura station to Yokohama station and transfer trains to get you directly there, and from there you can visit Chinatown a few blocks south and it's all within reasonable walking distance. However, if you add the World Poiters and Red Brick Warehouse, your day will get significantly longer because there's no direct train access between those places and its another 25 minute walk. 

Day 9: 

The Snoopy museum looks likes its pretty far from city center around 1 hour-ish, so keep in mind coming back to Shibuya. But other than Shibuya PARCO which is a must visit, if you walk north of Miyashita Park, there is a very non-touristy but chic shopping street that leads to Harajuku called Cat St, where you can find a hand crafted cola shop called Iyoshi Cola.","Day 6- be aware that almost everything in Akihabara opens at 11 so going earlier would be a waste of time. And many, many stores are either in basements or high floors, or have multiple floors that involve climbing stairs and only the bigger/most important have elevators. Also there's usually no room for a wheelchair due to the size of hallways and amount of merch everywhere. It's hard enough to walk with a backpack.


Day 7- skip public transport if you're gonna have a wheelchair during rush hour. Nakamise will also be a challenge due to the sheer amount of people there.


8- Hasedera is not wheelchair accessible. It's walking up stairs all the way.",,,

The general lack of consideration of travel times between locations could make one think AI was used. To make this work you‚Äôd need around another week at the absolute minimum.¬†,"I think that you‚Äôre trying to hit too many places. I‚Äôd say that Iya Valley needs at least one full day to be worth the travel there, or at least two full days days if only using public transport. Kanazawa as well has a lot to see and needs at least a full day. At the moment you would be spending 4+ hours travelling to each of Iya and Kanazawa and would likely have less time than that to explore each place in daylight.

My advice would be to choose just one of Iya and Kanazawa/Shirakawago. Also maybe find somewhere else of interest to briefly stop off in the long journeys from Matsuyama to Kanazawa or Iya to Tokyo. I‚Äôd also consider doing Shirakawago (if you do end up going there) as a day trip from Kanazawa, as staying in a gassho house would be a cool experience but it‚Äôs much more convenient travel-wise to wake up in the city with good train connections

Finally, I‚Äôd just double check when the autumn foliage is going to properly be out in each place! I saw some incredible foliage on Mount Takao a couple of years ago but that was on 1st December‚Ä¶ I think it was later than usual that year, but I wouldn‚Äôt rely on having much in October",,,

Questions:

1. Would we be able to see any autumn colors around this time anywhere in our itinerary?
2. Are the 2 separate day-trips to Kyoto practical? We planned to minimize carrying luggage around

Im not an expert at all, planning my first trip as well. 

My first day is very similar to yours, but instead of extending to Ryoan ji/Kinkaku ji I will focus on all the other temples in the Arashiyama area (Jojakkoji, Gioji, Otagi Nenbutsuji, eventually the moss temple Saihoji). 
It makes it easier because you can walk around all of them, then when temple close up you can take a train to Gion and enjoy the evening there.

1nbhv1g,"Questions: Takayama Inari Shrine, Aomori Prefecture","Hi r/JapanTravel 

I am coming from Australia to do a few things away from the main 3 and I have never been north of Tokyo before. I found the Takayama Inari Shrine and wanted to see if anyone had been here before and had some information on the location and accessibility as well.

  
I looking to go between the 4-6th Feb 2026 on the way up to the Sapporo Snow Fest. The main questions I have are following, but I am also interested in any other advice or recommendations around this that you may have!

1. Is this easily accessible from Aomori city? I have been looking at Google Maps for times and it seems it could be limited options for getting there and back.
2. Should I take food with me or are there food options nearby/within (like Fushimi Inari in Kyoto, but I guess this would be a lot quieter of a location)? 
3. How long should I allocate for exploring this (as an estimate but not including the travel)?
4. Are there any special traditions or customs for this particular location?

I appreciate the help!",https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1nbhv1g/questions_takayama_inari_shrine_aomori_prefecture/,"1. Renting a car is a best option. Thus said, if you have never driven on snow/ice - probably not a good one either. There are train and bus combinations that can get you there, but the buses are infrequent and may not run if there is too much snow.

2. It's middle of nowhere.

3. If you want to go through the whole shrine - you should plan for a full day. It's 3.5 km through sometimes deep and wet snow. Note that this shrine is made truly accessible during winter only for New Year's festival.

4. Except that this is one of the oldest shinto shrines in northern Tohoku and Cheseborough memorial? Not really.",,,,

And any critical thing we are missing or something we should remove?

Thank you!!",https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1nbi7k5/honeymoon_in_japan/,It's the same as every other itinery prepared by people who rely on instagram and Reddit.,"Please don't go go-karting, it's loud, obnoxious, smells and is universally disliked! 


There will be lots of walking, particularly in Tokyo, I recommend you pick an area, pop the places into Google maps and see what is kind of clumped together to plan each day.


No one is going to know what you're into, definitely recommend you think about what it is that you want to do on your honeymoon- not just based on the golden route and social media! 


For example I always recommend a day trip to Kamakura or Enoshima as it's a great day out and that you allow time to soak in Japan not just go tourist stop to tourist stop. there's multiple teamlabs that are open (including a new Kyoto one)- so one of those might be more your thing! 


Cherry blossoms will depend on mother nature, there will be forecasts leading up to your trip, check it out and if you're lucky- you'll see them just about everywhere!","Me and my partner were in Hakone a couple of weeks ago for the first time and personally I didn't rate it. The hakone loop feels very touristy and you don't see that much other than Fuji if it's visible.

However, our time at Hakone was kinda rushed.

Never took a taxi once. The busses/trains/underground are great everywhere so you just need a IC card or go onto the app klook and purchase 24/48/78 hour pases for the are you are in.","You‚Äôre packing way too much in, imo. It very much looks like you combined five different ‚Äúmust do in Japan‚Äù articles (which I get, you need to start somewhere!) but it‚Äôs not practical at all. There‚Äôs an hour on public transport between Fushimi Inari and Arashiyama for example. If you get to Fushimi Inari early, that leaves you with an afternoon only to visit the bamboo forest, the monkey park and walk around in the area, eat etc.
Same with Hakone. In one day, you plan to get there, enjoy the onsen in a ryokan, do the ropeway and a cruise. That‚Äôs way too much!

Rather than relying on AI and checklists, I‚Äôd really recommend taking a step back and thinking about what it is you want to experience in Japan, what appeals to you, why you want to see and why. For example, you‚Äôre really interested in onsens and ryokans? Do your research and look for one that really appeals to you, plan to spend a couple of days there to relax and experience it.¬†
I also think it‚Äôs a good idea to add a few buffer days so that if you need to rest and have a nap, you can",

It's doable if you want to go place to place, see them and leave but I know if it was me- I probably am not going to enjoy or appreciate Nikko in a day around 5 hours of travel.


I would consider cutting down the day trips and aim for 2-3 things in a day maximum and soak in things a bit more and allow time to get a little lost and enjoy rather than go place to place to see them.",Hakone to Mt Fuji area takes 3-4 hours by public transit. Day 3 is simply not possible by buses unless you have your own car rental. Either skip Mt fuji entirely or add 1-2 nights in kawaguchiko area,"I‚Äôm on a 17-day trip in Japan as we speak and your itinerary is super packed with lots of moving around. You will be surprised how much time it takes to move around, shop, research things, like public transportation, food, rest, etc.

Not sure what ya‚Äôlls budget is like, but if you‚Äôre going to rely solely on public transportation, like me, I‚Äôm averaging 10+ miles of walking a day and my feet are killing me. If you are going to be moving around carrying luggage, I hope you can handle it. So many subways will force you to take many flights of stairs up and down to either exit or get to the platforms you will need. I‚Äôm pretty active and in good shape and have been challenged on some days. At least you‚Äôre traveling at a time with better weather because it is pretty hot/humid right now.

As an alternative, I would recommend scrapping Hiroshima, and replacing it with a day trip to Kobe instead, which I really liked. It‚Äôs relatively close to Kyoto/Osaka and it should save you on an extra Shinkansen trip because if you guys are carrying checked-sized luggage, you will be forced to upgrade your seats. My only Shinkansen trip was earlier today from Osaka to Yokohama and it cost me about $150. 

I hope this helps and that you have a lovely trip!","It's impossible to leave Osaka, visit Hiroshima, Miyajima, and return to Tokyo in just one day. It takes about a four-hour trip

Consider staying overnight in Hiroshima, and I don't think you could even get to Miyajima that way",
1nbdf0k,Itinerary for 6 days - Kioto & Osaka,"[Context: It‚Äôs my first time visiting Japan and overall my first time traveling alone (25F). Guided tours are very common in my country, especially when it comes to longer distances. I‚Äôm thinking about taking a few to cover the most hectic itineraries in order to relax a bit and have more context of the places I‚Äôm visiting. I‚Äôve done some math and it seems like a tour is close to what I would have to pay in transporting anyway (40 usd per day, relying solely on public transportation)

Hello there! I‚Äôve made reservations for 3 days in Kioto and another 3 days in Osaka and so far, I‚Äôve covered Kioto day 1 and Osaka day 2 & 3, but have had some problems arranging what to do in between.

So, very loosely, this what I‚Äôve come up with:

Day 1 - Kioto
12 pm Arrival from Tokyo
1.30 pm Guided walking tour through Kioto that covers Ponto-ch≈ç Alley, Gion Shirakawa, Tatsumi Daimy≈çjin Shrine, Maruyama Park, Chion-in Temple, Dai-un-in, Nene no Michi, Ninen Zaka Path, H≈çkan-ji (Yasaka Pagoda), Konpira Shrine, Hanamikoji Street & Gion Kagai Art Museum
[Just putting in all there to not book the same locations twice by accident]

Day 2 - Kioto
Fushimi Inari
Uji

Day 3 - Kioto
Higashiyama District
Kiyomizudera
Kodai ji
[Very unsure as I‚Äôve seen that recommended paths cover a lot of what I have considered for day 1]

Day 4 - Osaka
Kinkakuji
Nara in the afternoon 

Day 5 - Osaka
Guided tour through:
Katsuo-ji
Adashino Nenbutsu-ji Temple
Arashiyama

Day 5 - Osaka
Mijayima + Hiroshima daytrip

As you can see I have some tours reserved but could cancel them or have them scheduled for another day. My idea is to have 2-3 focal points per day and check out details later on. Right now I‚Äôm especially worried about those days in between as I feel like they‚Äôre not necessarily the more efficient routs.

I‚Äôd rather take at least another tour to cover a day where the most travel is expected, but I‚Äôm unsure about it since the options Ive seen cover Fushimi inari + Nara, Nara + Uji or some other arrangement and I have a bit of trouble trying to fully get the distances between the different places.

Would love to have some feedback and recommendations for tour routes if you have any. Thank you!:)
",https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1nbdf0k/itinerary_for_6_days_kioto_osaka/,"Hey Op, just keep in mind that some folks on this sub have a very specific idea about Japan and traveling!  I find this sub is helpful for getting recommendations on places to see and also practical knowledge about etiquette. But in terms of folks taking time to understand where you're coming from and what you're looking for, especially with the questions you're asking, you maybe setting yourself up to get a lot of comments that aren't really what you're looking for. So you may want to restructure your questions to be more direct and specific like for example. Like for example, I'm trying to tackle these places in this time frame is this an efficient route. Because otherwise you'll get bunch of folks telling you not to do tours, etc because it doesn't fit their idea of a vacation. Or just how easy it is to learn Japanese, etc... Hope this is helpful!","I wonder why you need this many tours in the first place. Do you feel like you'd get lost without a guide? Or do you just want someone to provide context to what you're visiting?

Anyway, Nara, Uji and Fushimi Inari are quite close to Kyoto (or rather, Fushimi Inari is *in* Kyoto). It's certainly possible to do both Nara and Fushimi or Uji in one day (depending on how long you stay at each location, of course).","Day 4 - in what order do you plan to do Osaka Kinkakuji and Nara ? Those destinations are a little spread out in case you don‚Äôt realise !

I would also only do one guided tour, the charm of Japan is wandering by yourself. I‚Äôm also a solo traveller (28F)

How motivated are you to see Miyajima and Hiroshima ? You only have 6 days and that‚Äôs quite a bit of travel time. Don‚Äôt get me wrong they look great (I‚Äôm going in November for my second Japan trip) but maybe you‚Äôre better off staying near Kyoto/Osaka since this is a short trip? Up to you ! Arashiyama or more Kyoto exploring could be more efficient!","I don't think guided tours are necessarily bad, I don't think everyone wants to roam around by themselves if they don't speak the language and don't know the local culture.

And sometimes guides can take you to places regular tourists can't, or at least jump the line (probably less likely in japan though).

I think a walking tour in places like Kyoto is very helpful in learning the history as well.

Having said that, Day 5 is not going to be pleasant, even if it's possible. To take a train to Hiroshima and to get onto a ferry to an island and back on the same day is very very ambitious. Those ferries don't run every 5minutes and you do have to line up to get on or at least get your tickets early. Miyajima is big and spread out, there's some hiking you need to do, surely if you only get there and stay by the pier it's totally doable but you won't see 90% of the island and it's like what's the point of spending like an hour to get to and from the island?",
1nb5eta,HELP! A curveball in my itinerary that may change everything.,"¬†Hello! We‚Äôve started looking into accommodations and realized that many places in Kyoto are already showing as fully booked for our travel dates. We‚Äôve secured our stay in Osaka, but this has thrown us a bit of a curveball.

While searching, we noticed that several hotels in Kyoto are either fully booked or located quite far from the temples, bars, and main areas we‚Äôd like to explore. We‚Äôve considered the possibility of visiting another city instead, as we don‚Äôt want to end up in accommodations that make traveling around more difficult. At the moment, we‚Äôre looking into **Ine** and **Hakone** as alternatives to Kyoto.

That being said, I‚Äôd really appreciate some guidance from those who have traveled Japan more often. I‚Äôve shared our itinerary outline below in hopes that someone might help clear things up or provide advice on whether we should keep pushing for Kyoto or shift gears.

Are flights booked? You could try seeing if flying into Osaka is cheaper than Tokyo plus a Shinkansen ride.¬†

",https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1nb3faf/june_japan_trip/,"3 days in Tokyo is likely not enough. You may need to decide if you want to cut out of Osaka or Kyoto. 

Be prepared..June will be hot. It will impact your ability to be out and about.


Your flight and hotel cost is very high. Unless you are staying at high end hotels and plan to shop a LOT...this is fairly high. 

Feel free to DM ... I am Canadian and been to Japan quite a few times","You can read this to have a rough idea about budget [https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2410.html](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2410.html)

For flights you can look at any aggregator site like Google Flights or Skyscanner to check average prices.

Day 7- Kabukicho, Golden Gai and Omoide Yokocho (especially these last two) are places to visit at night to drink and eat, so you basically have the billboard that takes like 10 minutes to watch and Kabukucho, which is not that expansive, planned for daytime.","Flights and hotel seem a bit high, but it depends on how many rooms you book if you each book a room then it kinda make sense

For daily budget you won't be able to spend more than $200 pp a day on average, including local transportation. Obviously if you book special activities or fancy meals or shop for a grand seiko that goes on top.

While I don't think you need to see everything in one trip, I would say staying 3 days in each city is kind of pushing it only because checking in and out of hotels and taking Shinkansen back and forth eat up a lot of time.","Flights are going to depend a lot on where your flying out of in Canada. A quick search on Google Flights got me the following:


Cheapest flight out of Vancouver actually connects in Calgary for $1062 RT on West Jet.


Calgary direct $1043 round trip.



Toronto was $1300-$1700 depending on connections or direct to HND being $1675. Air Canada is the only airline that flies directly from Toronto.


Clearly there is a lot of variance with west coast people having much cheaper options.¬†


You can setup a flight tracker on Google Flights to email you as flights change prices for your travel dates.


Your flight there will likely equal two calender days and the return will be the same day due to time zone magic. You can also try looking into flying into Osaka and out of Tokyo or vice versa. Narita is about an hour and half east of Tokyo so adding that to you time travelling to Osaka it might make more sense to land in HND then go to Osaka or reverse your itinerary to do Tokyo -> Kyoto/Osaka.


I found hotels in Japan to be on par with Canadian pricing but the rooms are half the size so consider that.


In terms of places to stay in Tokyo, just find something near a major station. The city is well connected that you can just stay a few stops away and save money on hotels.¬†


June will be getting into the hot and wet season so be prepared for that.",
1nb4mxi,Itinerary Advice for JR Hokuriku Area Rail Pass,"Hi, 

My friend and I will be travelling with the very convenient Hokuriku area pass from 20-23rd October. It has unlimited 4-day shinkansen/other rail travel around the region. The cities covered along the main shinkansen line are Kurobe Unazaki Onsen, Toyama, Shin-Takaoka, Kanazawa, Komatsu, Kaga Onsen, Fukui, Tsuruga.

The current schedule is as follows:



***20/10 Toyama, Kurobe Gorge***

* Arrive 05:30 off nightbus (hopefully after a good snooze). Konbini breakfast, find internet cafe to sit/nap for couple hours?
* 07:40/08:40 Shinkansen to Kurobe Unazaki Onsen, train to Unazaki Onsen, walk to Kurobe Gorge railway. (about an hour's travel total)
* 09:42 gorge train round trip (about two hours). The scenic railway is only open between Unazuki-Nekomata due to last year's earthquake but still it feels worth it.
* Hour travel back for lunch (13:30 or 14:00)
* Optionally Bus to visit folk craft village and temple (anytime before last admission at 16:30)
* Back into town for dinner
* Stay overnight Toyama



***21/10 Kanazawa, ShirakawaGo***

* 09:09 Toyama shinkansen to Shin-Takaoka, then bus to ShirakawaGo. Arrives 11:45.
* Wander around and lunch in ShirakawaGo, earliest bus back is at 13:50
* Bus arrives in Kanazawa at 15:00 earliest, wander round (Kenrokuen or Higashichaya?) and dinner in Kanazawa
* Stay overnight Kanazawa



***22/10 Kanazawa, Kaga Onsen***

* Explore Kanazawa some more (Kenrokuen and Kanazawa Castle or Omicho?)
* 13:04 Kanazawa shinkansen to Kaga Onsen, then 14:00 shuttle bus to ryokan.
* Chill out at ryokan (dango rolling, sake tasting, tea and sweets, onsen)
* stay overnight at ryokan.



***23/10 Fukui***

* Shuttle from ryokan to station at 11:00, then 11:32 shinkansen to Fukui
* Not sure what to do this day. Fukui attractions are really spaced out, most appealing/closest is Eiheiji Buddhist Temple. Not interested in Dinosaur museum unfortunately.
* Maybe slightly silly but could be worth it going to Obama just to say ""I went to Obama"". It's also well-known for seafood which is another plus.
* 17:49 Train from Tsuruga station to Shin-Osaka station to meet with other friends and end the journey.



I don't know the area very well at all, so would really appreciate any suggestions or recommendations. Some info is that we both enjoy seafood, we are interested in both pop-culture (manga, anime, games) and traditional/historical culture, we speak some Japanese, we are mobile and enjoy walking round cities/parks, but won't have the appropriate gear for hiking/long walks.

",https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1nb4mxi/itinerary_advice_for_jr_hokuriku_area_rail_pass/,"That's an extremely rushed itinerary. You mention going to Obama just to say you went there but that's what you're doing with almost every place.

You can't wander around Toyama if you get there at 14, need to have lunch and get on a bus to get to the folk village before 16:30. You won't have much time to visit that either.

You're going all the way to Shirakawago for only 2 hours. That's equal to the time it takes to get to and from there. You'll also have two halves of a day in Kanazawa, one of which will be after sunset (same with the time you'll have in Toyama).

You want to spend less than 5 hours in Fukui and that's not counting the travel time you'll spend there to get you wherever you want to visit (the main attraction is the Prefectural Dinosaur Museum).",This is a pretty rushed itinerary.  You can easily spend 2 days in Kanazawa alone and 2 days in Toyama.  Shirakawago takes like 2 hours to get there and 2 hours to get back.  I don't quite understand why you're taking a night bus to Toyama when you could get a Hokuriku Arch Pass and take the Shinkansen from Tokyo to Toyama.   It sounds like your friend is trying speed run Hokuriku region just to say they've been to all the touristy areas no offense.,,,
1natl7l,Where Should I Add An Overnight Onsen In My Itinerary?,"**Hi everyone!**  
This October I‚Äôll be in Japan for two weeks with my wife. Our main bases are Tokyo, Kyoto, and Takayama, but I‚Äôd love to swap one of those nights for a stay at an onsen ryokan.

Here‚Äôs the current plan (14 days):

**Days 1‚Äì4 ‚Äì Tokyo Base**

* **Day 1:** Land at NRT ‚Üí settle in ‚Üí evening walk around Asakusa (Senso-ji lit up, old streets).
* **Day 2:** Tsukiji Outer Market in the morning ‚Üí Meiji Shrine + Harajuku ‚Üí Shibuya Crossing ‚Üí finish in Shinjuku (Golden Gai/Omoide Yokocho).
* **Day 3:** Day trip to Kamakura ‚Üí return for Tokyo dinner/nightlife.
* **Day 4:** Edo-Tokyo or Samurai Museum ‚Üí Yanaka Ginza stroll ‚Üí Skytree or Roppongi night views.

**Days 5‚Äì10 ‚Äì Kyoto Base**

* **Day 5:** Shinkansen to Kyoto (\~2.5h) ‚Üí Gion stroll ‚Üí dinner along Pontocho Alley.
* **Day 6:** Kiyomizu-dera ‚Üí Higashiyama lanes ‚Üí Philosopher‚Äôs Path & Nanzen-ji ‚Üí evening Gion walk.
* **Day 7:** Arashiyama: Bamboo Grove, Tenryu-ji, monkey park/riverside ‚Üí evening izakaya hopping.
* **Day 8:** Nara day trip: Todai-ji, deer park, Kasuga Taisha ‚Üí back to Kyoto for Yasaka Shrine at night.
* **Day 9:** Uji day trip: Byodo-in Temple + matcha tasting ‚Üí evening in Kyoto.
* **Day 10:** Himeji day trip ‚Üí return to Kyoto.

**Days 11‚Äì13 ‚Äì Takayama Base**

* **Day 11:** Travel Kyoto ‚Üí Takayama (\~3h) ‚Üí markets, Takayama Jinya, Edo-style old town.
* **Day 12:** Morning markets ‚Üí possible side trip to Kamikochi + Okuhida Onsen ‚Üí evening stroll.
* **Day 13:** Shirakawa-go & Hida day trip ‚Üí return for evening in Takayama.

**Day 14 ‚Äì Back to Tokyo**

* Takayama ‚Üí Tokyo (\~4.5h) ‚Üí last-minute shopping (Ginza/Akihabara) before flight next day.

**What I‚Äôm looking for in an onsen stay:**

* An outdoor rotenburo with a beautiful natural backdrop (mountains, forest, river, etc.).
* Bonus if it has that milky blue water (like Adachiya), but clear water is fine if the setting is special.
* Ideally a private rotenburo for couples, but I‚Äôd also consider a mixed onsen with a really scenic view.
* Would be nice if there‚Äôs at least a small area to wander nearby (a village or a few shops), though relaxation is the priority.

I keep seeing recommendations for Okuhida Onsen, but photos online are all over the place ‚Äî some rustic, some riverside, some mountain views. I even found one photo of exactly what I want (open-air bath, retaining wall, mountain backdrop, mixed bathing) but couldn‚Äôt identify which ryokan that was.

üëâ So here‚Äôs my question:  
If you were me, where would you add an overnight onsen stay in this plan? Near Takayama (like Okuhida)? Somewhere closer to Kyoto? Or even within reach of Tokyo? I‚Äôd love recommendations from anyone who‚Äôs actually stayed overnight and can point me to the most scenic and romantic onsen experience for a couple.",https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1natl7l/where_should_i_add_an_overnight_onsen_in_my/,"Wherever there's availability. You're booking quite late for October. Ryokan/onsen type places get booked out 6months-1year ahead

I personally only tried onsen in Okuhida and would recommend as it has the most ~feels~","In my opinion, the easiest spot to add an overnight onsen in your plan is near Takayama. Okuhida Onsen is less than an hour by bus and has lots of ryokan with outdoor baths facing the mountains or rivers, plus many offer private rotenburo you can reserve as a couple. If you‚Äôd rather do it earlier, Kinosaki Onsen near Kyoto is a charming bath town, and Hakone/Kawaguchiko near Tokyo have ryokan with Fuji views. But after writing this, I still think that Okuhida is the most natural addition to your trip and something not so mainstream‚Äôish like Hakone.","Check out kakurean hidaji (fukuji onsen, one hr bus from takayama)","Takayama have quite a few really nice onsen hotels. I think thats your best bet as onsen in kyoto and tokyo are really high end and tend to be expensive to stay at.   
I wouldnt stay at an onsen hotel longer than 1/2 nights. Most of the time they include set meals which are delicious but the textures can be challenging to the western palate.   
  
Generally, I would recommend going to Mount Fuji area (Hakone) and staying at Hakone Kowakien Ten-yu -but you seem to be skipping Fuji.","We've stayed in a couple onsens in Hakone and a few in Kawaguchi! I would definitely recommend trying to add one into your stay. They're a fun and unique experience.

I think you could make Hakone work on your way to Kyoto. We stayed at the Ryokan Ginyu. Great mountain view. The onsens are great and they have a couple private onsen you can reserve.

 We gotten a few rooms with private onsens before but this one was probably the best we've seen. Had a huge balcony with view. Could have stayed in our private onsen all day but we wanted to try all of them. 

You can do the majority of the hakone loop before checking on depending when you arrive."
1nauywo,Osaka-Naoshima-Hiroshima itinerary sense check mid-November '25,"Hi everyone! I‚Äôm heading to Japan for the second and third weeks of November 2025.¬† I would need you to sense check the final leg of my trip (**Osaka-Naoshima-Hiroshima**) spending 5 days in total. 

I love walking, exploring, and packing a lot into my days, but I want to make sure my itinerary is realistic and not overly ambitious. Photography is also my greatest passion. I‚Äôd also love to hear if I‚Äôm missing any must-see spots or if there‚Äôs anything I should tweak.¬† 

In particular, I‚Äôm not sure whether my timing for **Naoshima** is realistic ‚Äì I wonder whether I should spread that plan over the whole day or add more things to see.¬† Here‚Äôs my draft plan:

¬†**Day 1: Osaka**

* Morning: Travel to Osaka by train
* Afternoon: Castle Park (Osaka Castle).
* Evening: Dotonbori (Glico Man sign, Ebisubashi bridge, street food), Shinsekai & Tsutenkaku Tower (if time allows).

¬†**Day 2: Day trip to Nara from Osaka**

* Arrive in Nara (Kintetsu-Nara Station)
* Kasugataisha Shrine

* Great Buddha Hall at Todai-ji Temple¬†
* Gardens at Isuien Garden or Yoshikien Garden
* K≈çfukuji Temple
* Mochiidonocho ‚Äì Nara‚Äôs Old Town Shopping District
* Higashimuki Shopping Street
* Depart back to Osaka

**Day 3: Naoshima**

* 6:45 AM - Depart Osaka: JR Sanyo Shinkansen (Hikari/Sakura) from Shin-Osaka to Okayama (45 min). Transfer to JR Uno Line to Uno Station (50 min). Arrive at Uno Port by 8:45 AM.
* 8:55 AM - Ferry: Take the 9:22 AM ferry to Miyanoura Port (20 min, ¬•300, not JR Pass-covered). Arrive by 9:45 AM in Miyanoura.

* 10:30 - 10:45 ‚Äì Cycle to Museum Area.
* 10:45 - Benesse House Museum, Gotanji Beach and Yayoi Kusama‚Äôs Yellow Pumpkin (free, beachside). Spend 1 hour.

* 12:45 ‚Äì 1:00 PM Cycle to hotel in Honmura
* 1:00 PM ‚Äì Check in hotel
* 2:00 PM - Art House Project. Spend 2 hours
* *\[****Q****: not sure whether the timing I estimated is realistic - would you recommend adding more things to visit or spreading this plan over the whole day?\]*

**Day 4: Hiroshima**

* 9:15 AM - Depart Naoshima. Catch 9:45 AM ferry to Uno. Take JR Uno Line to Okayama (10:10 AM, arrive 11:00 AM). Take train to Hiroshima.
* Shukkei-en Garden, Hiroshima Castle, Peace Memorial Park, Atomic Bomb Dome, Atomic Bomb Hypocentre Monument, Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum. 
* *\[****Q****: I know this is extremely overpacked - would you recommed dropping the museum?\]*

* Morning: Itsukushima Shrine (floating torii gate), Daisho-in Temple.
* Afternoon: Mount Misen (Miyajima Ropeway), Omotesando shopping street.
* Return to Hiroshima in the evening.",https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1nauywo/osakanaoshimahiroshima_itinerary_sense_check/,"In Hiroshima - all of these things (Peace Memorial Park, Atomic Bomb Dome, Atomic Bomb Hypocentre Monument, Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum) are walkable right around each other so depending on how long you like to linger, we only spent maybe 2-3 hours there and skipped the museum.",Any tips on Naoshima?,"Looks manageable to me.


I would skip Hiroshima Castle over the Peace Museum.



The Benesse House Museum is open pretty late so maybe consider going to Honmura and doing the Art Houses first. The art houses sometimes have a queue for entry and may be busier this year because of the trienniale.


There's a bit of walking between the art houses though if you're cycling you may be able to get around quickly. Keep in mind that the island roads are really steep so hopefully you are comfortable with that. Chichu doesn't need an hour honestly, 30 minutes would suffice.¬†


There are quite a few outdoor installations in Naoshima so its a nice place to explore rather than a focused itinerary on getting from Point A to Point B. If you're staying overnight in Honmura I recommend booking dinner as its hard to find a place. Cafe Salon Naka Oku is a great place.","The Peace Museum is arguably Hiroshima's most important and impactful site. It would be a big mistake skipping it. Skip the castle instead.

If you like photography go up Koganeyama park. You'll have incredible 360 views of the whole city.",

1nae9nt,Itinerary help :) Tokyo,"
Hi everyone,

I've done a first run at a Tokyo itinerary and would love some feedback on how feasible it is (or if anyone has improvements/additions).

We've got a few things scheduled that cannot be moved (Sumo Club in Asakusa, TeamLabs, Disney) but everything else is changeable... Thanks in advance for any advice.

Little more information. I 41(M) am going with my husband. I grew up loving anime and he loves the traditional things. After Tokyo we are also going to Kyoto/Nara for a few days so there will be time for more shrines :)

Thanks for the help!


Couple specific questions:

1) is skytree worth it? If we skip skytree we will likely do a tea ceremony in Asakusa.... would this be a better use of time? Neither of us are super set on skytree, I just want to try to get into the Kirby cafe and heard the shopping was good üòÖ

2) I've heard mixed things about the Ghibli Museum (and also that it's impossible to get tix). If we scrap the museum is it theoretically possible to do Ikebukaro, Harajuku and Shibuya in a day?

Thanks for the help :)

You have to determine what activity you'd like more. I'd personally go to the Tokyo Met. Gov. Building observatory at night to also watch the projection mapping show. If after that you feel you need another observatory then go to the Skytree or any other of the many around Tokyo.

I think the difficulty to get tickets is about Ghibli park, not the museum. Without the museum you can do Shibuya, Harajuku and Shinjuku in a day but not extensively since there are LOTS of malls and shops everywhere on top of the two parks and shrine. Same with Akihabara and Ikebukuro. You can do both in 7 hours but you won't have time to visit lots of shops and browse inside just because of the amount there are.",I see you're really into ghibli and I recommend going to shirohige's cream puff factory.

1nagop4,Looking for feedback on 8-9 Day Itinerary (Dec. 23 - Dec. 30/31),"Hello, I am planning a trip for 7-9 people being some friends and family
to Japan towards the end of December (Dec. 23 - Dec. 30/31). 
It's cureently 7 to 9 as my aunt and cousin are waiting to see if their Visas get approved as
they're from Vietnam. The 30th vs 31st is a toss up at the moment as we are still looking at tickets, but
If it's the 30th we will likely just explore the city we stay in + Nara, but 31st, we will try all 3.

Right now I am looking for some feedback and guidance on my current rough itinerary I have formed.

I was also heavily debating whether or not to just have the entire trip be in Tokyo, but me and my younger
sister would like to visit the Kansai area, and I think it would be a shame to pass up on the chance to do so.

For some context, we have booked the trip from LAX -> HND already, and booked our hotel
in Tokyo which resides in Kanda for Dec. 23 - 28. (my return flight has been booked, but it departs from Vietnam where I will stay a week)


I am pretty much deciding a lot of our trip as my family are going to be followers 
(where is the passion/enthusiasm??) with some exceptions with: 

- In general I believe me and my family definitely will prefer to look at nature over history, but 
that's not to say we will avoid it by any means.
- My younger sister eventually wants to get out of the big city area of Tokyo (I have some
day trips in mind for this while staying in Tokyo / Kansai areas).
- My older sister and her boyfriend going to Disney Sea for one day and wanting to visit matcha cafes

I have various shops I want to visit such as buying a used camera to try and
take photos during the trip, retro games, and various other electronics but these
are things that are easily searchable online, and much easier to incorporate into the itineary, so I will
try to focus more on asking for help on the more time consuming things.

For my wishlist in terms of stuff to plan, I was wanting
to visit Nikko or Enoshima Island as potential day trips (I'd love to do both but I don't think we would have
enough time), and being able to dip in an onsen or sento. (I have seen some potential hotels that have an onsen
in Kyoto, and maybe like one in Osaka).

Here's how the rough itineary I have formed looks like (if there aren't specific times, then it's just a rough
idea of what would occur that day).


**Dec. 23 First Day:** 

- Land HND 11am
- Arrive at Hotel around and drop off Luggage around 1pm
- Get Lunch in Kanda/Akiba
- Check In Hotel 3pm
- Rest for a bit, get settled
- Explore Akiba until Dinner
- Get Dinner


**Dec. 24 Shibuya/Shinjuku:**

- Shibuya/Shinjuku
- lunch
- explore/shop
- meiji jingu
- Go look at markets/illuminations
- Shibuya Sky


**Dec. 25:**

- older sister + her bf go to disney sea (this date is a place holder, unsure when they are actually going to go)
- thinking the rest of us go down to Yokohama possibly?


**Dec. 26:**

- Enoshima Island or Nikko Day Trip

If Enoshima (might be better to explore then come to these at night for the lights?): 

- Enoshima Sea Candle
- Iwaya Caves

If Nikko: 

- Shinkyo Bridge
- Akechidaiara Ropeway
- Kegon Waterfall
- Possibly Lake Chuzenji if time permits


**Dec. 27:**

- Likely just last day to explore anything not covered in Tokyo to not feel rushed, like seeing Ueno Park, Ginza, etc. and shop


For the Kansai Area I am still deciding which area to stay (Kyoto vs Osaka). Feel like it should be simpler to choose but I am very
bad at picking, especially if it's for a lot of people 


**Dec. 28 Tokyo -> Kansai:** 

- Check out of Hotel 11am
- Can either stay in Tokyo if desired by dropping luggages off in lockers (i think this should only happen if
we somehow managed to do a Nikko and Enoshima as separate day trips), and then take Shinkanzen to Kansai in the evening
or immediately go after lunch.
So roughly after checking out:
- Take Shinkanzen 1pm, arrive in Osaka/Kyoto around like 3:30pm 
- Check in Hotel 4pm
- Rest, then get an idea of the town 
- Find Dinner


**Dec. 29 Exploring either Osaka/Kyoto:** 

If Osaka:

- Minoh Park
- Dotonbori / somewhere in the city

If Kyoto:

- Senbon Torii
- Arashiyama Bamboo Forest
- Lake Biwa


**Dec. 30 Exploring the other of Osaka/Kyoto or Nara**

If Nara:

- Nara Park
- Yoshiken Garden or Isuien Garden?
- Naramachi Town


**Dec. 31 Exploring whichever wasn't covered yet / Departing**



I also am aware of the complications when visiting Japan with a large group with
being able to eat together, and possibly transportation space, and just being aware of our 
surroundings to try and not be in the way of locals but is there anything else I should be aware of as well?

So let me know your thoughts on this itinerary with any suggestions, feedback, and any comments
are just greatly appreciated in general. Did I go overboard? Anything you think I should add to the itinerary
in place of something else? Anything helps! My family rarely gets to go on trips so this is my first time planning
a trip to this scale, and I would like to put my best effort in being able to provide them a good experience to the best of my ability.
I also am aware of the comments of like ""skip osaka and just go all in kyoto, or skip kyoto because
there's too many people"" but I'm a tourist going there and I want to just experience as much as I can 
and form my own opinion. Take it in for what it is at that moment but make the most of it.


Sorry for the long post as I like to be as detailed as I can be while including some of my thoughts,
so thank you if you took the time to read all of it!


edit: I forgot to ask, for Nikko is it possible to plan the day I would possibly go to have some snow? Think the nature would look extremely beautiful if there was some, but I'm assuming snow isn't as likely in the beginning of winter, and likely more barren/dry.",https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1nagop4/looking_for_feedback_on_89_day_itinerary_dec_23/,"If you only have 7 days in Japan, stick to either the Tokyo or Kansai regions. It‚Äôs not enough time to see both, and this itinerary would have you moving cities most days of your short trip.

I‚Äôm a bit amused by your comment about 27 December being for anything you didn‚Äôt get round to seeing in Tokyo: it‚Äôs the world‚Äôs largest city and you are only seeing a handful of things there!","Definitely stay in one city. Just stay in Tokyo.

EDIT: I'll elaborate a little more. You will not enjoy your trip as much if you have to coordinate 7-9 people by yourself. You're the one planning, so they will follow your lead. You will feel overwhelmed at some point and that will ruin that day of your trip for you. Make it easy on yourself and just stick to one city and include 1-2 day trips. Trust me on this.

EDIT 2: There will always be another trip to Japan. How do I know? I'm going on my 4th trip this Dec into Jan. You will come back home and somehow, some way, make another trip happen, but with less people the next time. So, try not to do too much with such a big group on such a short trip, and just stick to one city.","So if you have to see the Kansai region then I‚Äôd probably leave Tokyo as early as possible on the 28th.  I know you‚Äôre calling this a ‚Äúfree day‚Äù but as you can see when you‚Äôre trying to cram in Osaka or Kyoto into this, you already don‚Äôt have enough days.  

I suspect that if you like Japan you‚Äôre going to want to come back in a much smaller group.  This one could be a pain in the butt.","You really are not seeing much of tokyo which is completely fine I don't think everyone needs to do Tokyo when they visit japan, but I do caution you for all these day trips with such a big group. Since you aren't an organized tour with coach bus picking you guys up and going to places point to point, having everyone navigate to a new place each day and have the same energy level to travel all day without the option of going back to hotel for a rest is very risky. Considering there will be diffweent ages, preferences, health condition and stamina, I wouldn't do back to back day trips.",
1n9in41,November 25 day trip itinerary,"Hello, I will be visiting Japan for the 2nd time, travelling alone, taking a long break before coming back to work. I'll be there between 07/11 (7 Nov) and 02/12.

Some motivation/direction for this trip: I'm mostly interested in seeing: temples, castles, nice natural spots. Very interested in local gastronomy and cooking. I like anime and manga, but not making it a big part of this trip.
White doing the above I want to see the autumn leaves (I'm aware that some of the places are after/before peak, but can't do perfect timing for everything, so tried to at least be in Tokyo for the peak times, which i read are around last week Nov, first week Dec).

Most of the days I plan on leaving the hotel around 6 am. And walking a lot is not a problem either.

Also, I like to avoid only 1 night in a place, unless it makes sense for the route (and there is literally only 1 or 2 things to see) or going to a ryokan/onsen.
(I haven't planned the Tokyo part yet, since I'll likely shuffle things between days, just trying to group several things into possible-1-day-trips, especially since i might meet some people there)

**15-17/11 Sendai**

15 - Leave early either train or direct bus (i had trouble finding info about the bus online) > Sendai > (Rairaikyo Gorge > Akiu Great Falls + Jigenji Temple) I haven't seen many things to do in Sendai itself. + Eat zunda (crushed edamame) and gyutan (tongue).

**20/11 Matsumoto**

20 - Arrive early at Masumoto > Matsumoto Castle > Nawate Shopping St > Narai and Kiso-Hirasawa area

**21-22/11 Otsuki**

21 - Here I'm not sure what to do, either:

* Go to Otsuki, drop bags, go back to Koshu for Tasting and to Hottarakashi Onsen, then to Maglev Exhibition Center (I'm also considering Yamato Transport)

* Spend another day at Matsumoto and make a day trip to one of the surrounding mountain towns/onsens and leave in the evening.

22 - Whole day at Kawaguchi area > Panoramic Ropeway > Stroll around lake a bit + Bridge > Kitaguchi Hongu Fuji Shrine > Arayayama Shrine > Oshino hakkai (will see how much time i have) > Chureito Pagoda by sunset

**23/11-25/11 - Yokohama**

23 - Shin-Yokohama Ramen Museum > Kirin Brewery Yokohama > Yokohama Chinatown > Red Brick Warehouse > Air cabin > Yokohama sky

24 - Yugawara (Fudo Fall > onsen town > Gosho Shrine) > Atami (Kiunkaku > Adult Museum > Atami Castle > Walk the beach) + Atami pudding + Atami fireworks

25 - Enoshima > Kamakura area (I read you can easily spend the whole day walking around here)

**26/11-1/12 Tokyo**

Still mostly TBD, some places i definitely want to visit in no particular order:

If you got this far thank you for reading, and if you have any suggestions on things to add/remove/replace I'd really appreciate them.

I always get the feeling that i could squeeze more places into the itinerary, but later enjoy being able to make a detour or just enjoying my time if i find a nice spot.",https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1n9in41/november_25_day_trip_itinerary/,"Sounds fun!


I tried doing the itinerary you suggested in Matsumoto but I booked accommodation with dinner and didn't end up having time to get to Narai and back. It's close by, but the public transit is infrequent, so watch out. You can't go wrong with an extra day in Matsumoto.¬†¬†


Also on Day 24 it took me a whole day to see that stuff in Atami + Kinomiya Shrine (a top sight in Atami IMO) so with also Yugawara it might be ambitious.¬† ¬†


For Aizu‚ÜíSendai this is the bus:¬†https://www.aizubus.com/highway/sendai/sendai_line_up","9- You must either mean Toshogu shrine or Rinnoji temple.

10- If you do the Senjogahara hike, you can keep going to Yumoto. You'll pass by Yumoto falls and the lake. In Yumoto you have the beach, the visitor center, a free foothbath and the sulphur coming out of the ground in the back of the town.

24- Too much for one day. I¬¥d visit Odawara castle instead of Atami castle. Odawara's is at least a reconstruction of an original one. Be aware that Atami fireworks just last 20 minutes and are not a grand show like others (still cool though). Also note that the trains will probably be packed as hell so it's a good idea to be on the back of the crowds and not on the beach since you can see fine from everywhere but you'll be able to get to the station faster. Be ready to walk uphill fast and climb many stairs to get there.

Takao sucks as a hike. Do either Mitake or Okutama.",,,

Questions:   
\- Any recommendations on a Calligraphy museum? There seems to be a ton, hard to tell where/what. Would love it if they had a mini-class, but not necessary. 

\- Would love to see a robots/futuristic museum in Tokyo, put in some options on day 7 but not really sure what the best place would be? 

\- Seems like Mt. Fuji is closed for hiking late September, can someone confirm? We were imagining mostly just hiking around Lake Ashi, it seems like there's some small trails there but would love recommendations

\- Is Oct 4 / Day 15 schedule in Kyoto too much? Planning on doing an audio tour (any rec's?), and from what I can tell most of the places are quicker stops

\- Is it possible to get any sort of tickets to Hashima Island (Nagasaki) same-day? Everything is sadly bought while we'll be there. 

\- Any other recommendations for Nagaski or the area? We had planned a day for Hashima Island before realizing their were no tickets available. 

  
General things we like:   
\- Outdoors: Hiking & Gardens in particular

\- Culture/History: Particularly things unique to the area or things important to our childhood (anime, ghibli, pokemon)

\- Technology / Industry

\- Food! Needa find a good food tour or three. Not drinking or partying much though. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1n9pind/itinerary_check_22_days_starting_late_september/,"I Highly doubt you have the time go to the Toyota museum on the same day as the Ghibli park. You need to do the Ghibli park first since you have to buy the tickets in advance and you don't know how much time it'll take.

Climbing Fuji out of season is prohibited. Only highly skilled climbers with well prepared teams do it at their own risk. Every year there are morons on the news that had to be rescued. Though you can hike Aokigahara forest and visit its caves. If you like Ghibli it has those vibes.

Spending a few days in Hakone and not doing the loop is kinda a waste.

Since you'll be in Nagoya you and like culture and history you can visit Inuyama. One of the 12 original castles remaining and one of the 5 declared national treasures, like Himeji. You also have the Shikemichi preservation district and the Meiji Mura Museum. If you like technology, ride the Linimo. It¬¥s the only working maglev in Japan.

Day 14- The Nintendo Museum is in Uji, not Kyoto. Since you'll be there you should at least visit Byodo-in.

Day 15 is impossible. You can either do the Arashiyama area-Kinkakuji or Kiyomizudera area-Kinkakuji.

Why Nagasaki instead of Hiroshima? It's an at least 4hs trip vs a 40 minute trip. You have the Peace Museum and park. If you want nature you have Miyajima and Okunoshima as day trips.",I'm planning to go later in the year and have been curious about the Art Aquarium Museum in Ginza - it might be something you want to consider?,,,

1n939cy,Is this 3-Day Nikko Itinerary Feasible?,"Hi everyone, I‚Äôm planning a short trip to Nikko as part of our 8 day trip to Japan in late November (21 - 29) [Tokyo - Nikko - Kanazawa] and want to check if my itinerary is doable.

Day 1 (Arrival Half-Day from Tokyo):

-Travel to Nikko (Tobu Limited Express from Shinjuku Station) - Arrival around 11:30 AM

-Lunch in town

-Toshogu Shrine, Futarasan Shrine, Shinkyo Bridge

-Dinner, stay overnight

Day 2 (Full Day ‚Äì Nature/Waterfalls):

-Kegon Falls + Lake Chuzenji + Akechidaira Ropeway (morning)

-Ryuzu Falls + lunch

-Senjogahara Marshlands (afternoon) - not planning on walking the entire route, just enough to see it and soak in the views

-Return to hotel, dinner

Day 3 (Departure Half-Day to Kanazawa):

-Breakfast, optional light stroll, check-out

-Depart for Kanazawa (10 AM)

Does this look feasible in terms of travel times and seeing everything without feeling rushed? Also is the full day doable without a car? Not really sure if I can fit everything together on that day. Really want to see the Marshlands as I've heard great things.

Also, we're staying in Fairfield Marriot. Open to staying closer to Nikko Town if there's a nice, same price as Marriott ($150/day) hotel around there. 
Also, if anyone has restaurant recommendations, I‚Äôm all ears. Any tips or adjustments appreciated!",https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1n939cy/is_this_3day_nikko_itinerary_feasible/,"Your plan looks quite realistic for a three-day stop in Nikko. Arriving around 11:30 on the first day leaves you enough time to have lunch and explore the shrine area in the afternoon with Toshogu, Futarasan and Shinkyo Bridge. That day will feel full but not rushed.

The second day is a bit trickier imho. Without a car, you‚Äôll be relying on buses, and while they do connect all the main spots, late November means fewer services than in peak autumn. The ride up to Lake Chuzenji takes about 40 to 60 minutes, so you need think about both travel time and waiting at the stops. Kegon Falls, the lake and Akechidaira Ropeway fit well into the morning. Ryuzu Falls and Senjogahara are further along the line but still reachable; if you only want a taste of the marshlands rather than a full hike, then it‚Äôs realistic to add them. Still, this will be a long day, so it makes sense to treat it as sightseeing by bus with short stops instead of an extended walk.

Your departure day is easy: leaving around 10 a.m. works fine. The Fairfield Marriott is comfortable but a bit outside of town. If you‚Äôd prefer to be able to walk to the shrines or to dinner spots, it could be worth staying near Tobu-Nikko Station or Shinkyo Bridge. For example, the Nikko Tokanso could be worth a look.

For food, you‚Äôll find local specialties like yuba and river trout everywhere. Check out Hippari near the Shinkyo bridge or Meiji-no-Yakata if you are looking for a more historical atmosphere near the shrine area. Around Lake Chuzenji you‚Äôll find several places focusing on trout dishes. Last but not least, I really like the Grill & Steak Myogetsubo near the Shinkyo bridge and if I‚Äòm in Nikko, thats were I will always have some coffee or food. :-)

Enjoy your trip!","For food go try the Yuba set meal at Yuba Cafe Hazuki - I'm still thinking about it 2 years later :)

Since you're staying overnight check out the Sake Cafe Lab 250 - you pay I think 300 yen for a shot of sake and you can try lots of different local flavours.  The owner was super friendly too!

I didn't see it in your schedule but I thought the walk from Nikko town to Kanmangafuchi Abyss was very beautiful and scenic.  There is also the Tamozawa Imperial Villa to visit.  Sorry I'm adding to your already packed schedule! Lol

But seriously Nikko has so much to see - enjoy your trip there!","I stayed in Fairfield Marriott. It‚Äôs about a 10-15 min uphill climb without luggage from the Nikko train station. 

Take note of sunset timings in Nikko at that time of year. If you are able to rent a car, we rented ours from a place near the train station. 

I did your Day 2 in early Dec 2023 - but I was staying in Okunikko and was a lot nearer to the sights already, and had a car. So just to give you an idea - we did Yudaki Falls, Marshlands (walked for about an hour plus before returning to car), went down to Ryuzu Falls, by the time we got to Kegon Falls, it was about 3.30pm or so. Sunset was generally at 4.30pm at that time of year. It is PITCH DARK after sunset. There are barely any street lights especially the lake Chuzenji stretch between Ryuzu Falls and Kegon Falls. The marshland area does NOT have street lights. Do not get stuck out there past sunset.

Bus frequencies are not reliable - you will need to leave as early as possible.",,

With only two days in Tokyo and plans to see the much more beautiful and spectacular places in Kyoto, you shouldn't waste your time on Gotokuji or Meiji Jingu. Instead, go to the Asakusa area on the east side of town.","I would skip the gotokuji cat temple. I last went around 8 years ago but it‚Äôs just one small section crammed up with lucky cats, the majority of the area looks like every other temple.","Not sure where you are flying in from so no idea if you‚Äôll have jet lag. I flew in from Chicago and first couple days were a bit strange since I went to bed so early and then woke up so early. 

Having a hard time figuring out if you have just the right amount of time in each area or not enough. As a first timer, you might not have enough time for all that. Maybe skip Nara and save it for another trip back?","When in Harajuku, check out Hamburg Yoshi for a delicious beef tongue steak and hamburg. And go to Menchirashi, the line is much shorter than Shin and its alot cheaper and taste equally good as well.",

Hello everyone,

My wife and I are expecting, so we want to go on a trip early November before fully commiting to raising our child, and we decided for Kyushu for 1 week.

My current itinerary is as follows:
- Fukuoka for 3 nights, with 2 day trips to Itoshima (Oyster) and Dazaifu
- Kumamoto for 1 Night
- Beppu and Yufuin for 2 nights
- Back to Fukuoka 1 night to catch our flight early morning

I am hesitating with:
- Kumamoto 3 days
- Kumamoto, Kagoshima then back to Fukuoka
Kumamoto, Nagasaki, Fukuoka

Some parameters to take into account:
- traditional hotel during weekend are insanely high even though we are in a less touristy spot than the golden route tokyo kyoto
- my wife being pregnant significantly reduce the type of activitity, also long commuting should be avoided
- Airbnb are more forgiving during weekend but quality is a bit or a miss
- Budget this time is a bit tighter than before because we save up for the baby.

Why Nagahama castle? Go to Hikone castle. It's one of the 12 originals remaining and one of the 5 declared national treasures.


Research more stuff to do in Fukuoka. Going all the way there just for Canal city (completely regular mall apart from the fountain show) and Ohori park is a waste.


Himeji castle instead of Wakayama. Same reasons as before. Plus it's the biggest castle in Japan.


Look into Kurashiki/Okayama and Mojiko/Shimonoseki. Both pairs of cities are more worthwhile than Kobe in my opinion. You can eat Kobe beef (and other kinds of wagyu) anywhere in Japan.


Nagoya has almost everything Osaka can offer, plus unique stuff in and around, without the insane crowds of tourists.","There‚Äôs a ton of back and forth here and going back thru areas you just were the day before.

I have a rough itinerary but Kanazawa is a wildcard. I only saw it as an alternative suggestion to Kyoto originally when I was initially planning to go in November to see foliage. I hear it's nice in December but it may snow (and be icy and colder) and perhaps is just too much so I'm thinking maybe it's not the best idea? If we were to cut Kanazawa out, I'm guessing we should allot more time in Tokyo and maybe Kyoto?

12/10 - Arrive HND around 4:30pm (catch limobus to avoid rush hour traffic - hotel likely in Shinjuku area closer to Yoyogi stations) - check into hotel, hang around Shinjuku area, grab dinner and then crash)

12/11 - Meiji Shrine, Yoyogi Park, Harukuju, Shibuya Crossing at night + Illuminations (maybe Blue Cave?)

12/12 - DisneySea (if it were Disneyland I'd skip but I hear DisneySea is pretty unique and the kids like Disney but we are not diehard fans either)

12/13 - Asakusa, Sens≈ç-ji Temple, Ueno Zoo/park(?), Sumida river walk, Tokyo Skytree (also Hello Kitty store for the daughter)

12/14 - Teamlabs Planet Toyosu, Toyosu market, Odaiba (I might try to see if I can get Sushi Daiwa.... I'm not sure if my pregnant wife will like this idea though hahaha)

12/15 - Shinkansen to Kanazawa - lunch or late lunch at Omicho market and Samurai District after

12/16 - Kenrokuen Garden and Kanazawa Castle

12/17 - Shinkansen to Kyoto (stay near Kyoto station)

12/18 - Kiyomizudera and Ninenzaka (Higashiyama area and probably no Fushimari Inari - I hear it would be too grueling for a pregnant woman)

12/19 - Arashiyama Bamboo Grove and Monkey Park

12/20 - Nara Deer Park

12/21 - Visit Uji(?) then train to Osaka (stay around Dotonbori and Namba station)

12/22 - USJ (kids have been reading tons of Harry Potter lately so this may be something we can't miss)

12/23 - Osaka Aquarium

12/24 - Low-key day to shop, buy luggage and souvenirs/snacks/etc. Hang around Namba area. Maybe Umeda Sky?

12/25 - fly out of Osaka Itami at 2:05pm (there is a connecting flight through NRT back to LAX - it's operated by ANA single ticket so it will be a connecting flight and luggage transfer handled by ANA)

I just realized there were some daytrips I was considering too, like Hakone, Kamakura, Nikko or Yokohama but it seems I'm forfeiting those in favor of the Kanazawa side-trip. Not sure if any of those would be recommended for my wife (probably not Nikko if there's a lot of climbing or hiking involved) though.",https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1n8jytp/suggestions_for_itinarary_14_full_days/,"I would not want to be pregnant rushing around like that. I LOVED Kanazawa but having to travel there spend a day and do the travel back. No way. That's exhausting. It takes a while to get there. 

The gardens and castle grounds are so nice and relaxing and the pass lasts for 2 days. Since the traveling wipes out a day a few nights stay was perfect for us.","12/19 -> Be warned the monkey park does include a 20min steepish climb to reach the top, it may be a little tiring. I‚Äôve never been pregnant but I hear it‚Äôs tough going for some people, may be worth checking.

Otherwise I‚Äôm biased to Kanazawa, but the gardens are beautiful and I loved the Saumurai district! I‚Äôve heard it doesn‚Äôt get *too* cold during the day though there is snow risk. Travel wise it‚Äôs average difficulty, it‚Äôs direct from Tokyo which is basically ~2h30 resting on a comfy quiet train, but you have to switch in Tsuruga I believe on the way to Kyoto. Have you considered forwarding your luggage to Kyoto if you decide to keep Kanazawa? Could be the difference between hard going and doable.","I'd personally skip Kanazawa and opt for 1-2 nights in Kawaguchiko. No way it's your first time and you don't try to see Mt. Fuji from up close. Pictures don't do it justice at all. Kawaguchiko has the best view of Mt. Fuji by far, especially from Oishi Park. The infamous Chureito Pagoda shot is also nearby, but your wife is pregnant, and your kids might not want to do hundreds of steps. There are 5 bus routes from Kawaguchiko that go to the surrounding areas, so lots to do.

Also, teamLab Borderless is better than Planets. 

Good luck with the wife and kids, and enjoy the trip.

EDIT: Your reply to my comment was deleted when I was going to reply to it, so I'll just post below:

Planets is a little more 'active' iirc, at least in the beginning.

Two nights, max, in Kawaguchiko. I usually stay north of the lake, between Nagasaki Park and Oishi Park, but it's farther away from the main area and no stores within walking distance; 15-min bus ride from Kawaguchiko station.

For convenience sake, I'd say stay within proximity of Kawaguchiko Station, but if you want a beautiful view of Mt. Fuji whenever you like, say sunrise, then somewhere around [here](https://maps.app.goo.gl/V7t2nShuV3vdVc4ZA). The closest convenience stores north of the lake are located in that area.

Your kids might like the amusement park, Fuji-Q Highland. There's Oshino Hakai, Samurai Village, and many more places to visit. Here's a [link to a visual of the bus routes](https://en.kawaguchiko.net/img/pdf/guide_map_en.pdf).",,
1n8j5t2,Itinerary for relaxed first timers (18 days),"Hello everyone!  
My friend and I are traveling to Japan from December 1‚Äì18, and it‚Äôs our first time there. What‚Äôs most important to us is getting a good first impression of Japan without rushing from place to place. We‚Äôre not so interested in hitting all the typical sightseeing spots‚Äîinstead, we‚Äôd like to experience the culture through flea markets, markets, temple visits, food, bars, and museums. I‚Äôve also taken a small Japanese course and I‚Äôm really looking forward to using the little bit I‚Äôve learned.

Do you think this itinerary is realistic? It‚Äôs important to us not to spend too much time on trains (we won‚Äôt be renting a car, just using trains). Are we too short on time in Takayama and the Kiso Valley? Or is there something else along our route that we should squeeze in, so that we only return to Tokyo a day later (say, December 15)? Also, are we spending too long in Tokyo for first-timers?

Go straight to Kyoto. One less accommodation. You don't have to lug around stuff you bought in Tokyo to other places, which is where you'll probably do most of your shopping. Also, 9-10 straight days in Tokyo will give you more flexibility in what you want to do on a day-to-day basis.

Consider 1-2 nights in Kawaguchiko instead of just a day trip. Checkout Yanaka Ginza in Nippori in the morning/noon (local shops close at 5 p.m.) and Ameyoko street in Ueno at nighti; both are two short stops from one another.","Dec 5- you need plans for the morning. Most places in Akiba open at 11.


What exaclty do you mean by ""Kiso Valley""? That's a region, not a place. The hike from Magome to Tsumago takes 3hs tops. You need something for the rest of the day and there aren't many options. You might want to keep hiking to Nagiso and explore since that's a somewhat bigger town. And what are you doing after the hike? Are you going back to the same ryokan?¬†


If you want to avoid long train rides, going from Takayama to the Nakasendo area and from there to Tokyo is maybe not the best idea.


Like @chataolauj said, go directly to Kyoto and leave Tokyo for the end of your trip.","Usually, I don't even bother with itineraries posted here, as they're almost universally overpacked and nobody wants to listen to reason, but you've actually managed a plan that's sufficiently loose. This is very good. You'll have a better time this way than trying to pack more in.",Any reason for skipping Osaka? Good to visit.,
1n8j4u1,September Itinerary Review,"I'll be leaving for Japan in just about 2 weeks for a  two week trip. I wanted to get some feedback about whether any of my days are overloaded or if anyone has suggestions on how to improve the trip and/or cut down on travel times.

Day 15 (Tokyo)
 - Return to Haneda for 10:55 flight. üò¢

Any suggestions would be great!",https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1n8j4u1/september_itinerary_review/,I‚Äôm the same height as you and honestly Japan isn‚Äôt bad at all for tall people. The only times I really notice it are when the train straps hit my head a bit or in older places like ryokan where the doorways are lower and I have to duck. Other than that it‚Äôs no big deal and you‚Äôll be totally fine.,"I don't know if you drink, but if you do, then on your birthday, go get drinks at Pontocho Alley in Kyoto.

As for your overall itinerary, I think you're jumping around way too much in terms of hotel accommodations. I count 7 different hotels in a span of 13 full travel days; days 1 and 15 don't count, especially with an early flight.

I don't know how feasible these suggestions are for you since your trip is in 2 weeks, but I'll type them out anyway.

I would move all your Tokyo days to the end of your trip, especially because of your early flight home. Make Kamakura and Nara day trips, as they generally are just day trips for many people. Kamakura from Tokyo and Nara from Kyoto/Osaka. Osaka could also be a day trip from Kyoto too honestly because your current itinerary for it is only one full day. This frees up 4-5 nights if I counted correctly. Your main places of accommodation would be Kyoto, Kinosaki Onsen, Takayama, and Tokyo, which is more relaxing for 13 full days of travel.

The issue now is how to sequence these places to optimize for travel time. These places are very spread apart. With quick research, I'd probably do it in this sequence **Kyoto -> Kinosaki Onsen -> Takayama -> Tokyo**. Kinosaki to Takayama would be 5-6 hours of travel; you'd transfer at Kyoto Station to head to Takayama.","You're trying to cram too much and also places that are too far from each other. That's a lot of wasted time changing hotels and traveling far distances that could be spent actually sightseeing.

You pass through Kyoto to get to Nara. Why spend a night in Nara adding a hotel change for only a full day there if it can be done as a day trip from Kyoto?

Same with changing hotels from Kyoto to Osaka just to spend a full day there. Do both Awaji Island and Osaka as day trips from Kyoto. You'll also be closer to Kinosaki that way.

Kinosaki to Kamakura wastes more than 6hs just traveling. You should go to an onsen in Hakone or somewhere else that makes sense geographically with your itinerary.

Tsukiji is not in Odaiba. You can get the same food anywhere else, so there's no need to go there and deal with the crowds.

Also, you'll basically not visit Tokyo?",,

Did I miss any *must dos*? I tried to leave evenings pretty open so we can add on as much as were feeling


We're traveling with a.. chaotic... 4 year old. He has traveled with us since he was born and we are used to big trips and lots of walking. I just wanted to include some things he may really like. The preteen plus myself and husband are going to just enjoy being in the country.  I wanted to find something Power Rangers...even if it is a shop with figurines


Preteen daughter is really into foxes but I was hesitant to look at the animal cafes d/t animal neglect and abuse. Any suggestions?


If I buy the Suica card for me, husband, and preteen, will that cover my entire trip (minus shinkansen)? I was confused if I needed the kansai one once in kyoto...


I know I mention taxi a lot but I am so worried about my sweet 4 year old disrespecting the culture. He is just a talkative kid and won't really understand why he all of a sudden is being shushed. Not loud or disruptive but there is always a topic to be discussed. What is etiquette on shinkansen? Do you chat with your parties or is it expected to be quiet as well?

teamLab Borderless is better than Planets.

That's an expensive taxi from Hakone to HND for Day 17. Tolls are common on Japan highways. Your last accomodation should always be the city in which you're flying out from. My recommendation for people will always be to move all their Tokyo days to the end of the trip. You're going to do most of your shopping in Tokyo and you definitely don't want to lug that stuff around with you everywhere.

Also, there's no need to forward your luggage from Kyoto to Osaka. It's only a 30-minute travel time between the two cities. Luggage forwarding does not guarantee same-day arrival.",Ninenzaka (and Sannenzaka) are directly in front of Kiyomizudera.,"You definitely want to eat dinner at your Hakone accommodation as there aren't many restaurants open for dinner in the area since most people go back to the ryokan in the evening to relax.

1n8dgt0,5 Day Itinerary - Any advice would be helpful,"Hello everyone, I just want to check in on my itinerary. Any advice would be helpful.

A really convenient bus takes you from Shinjuku to Kawaguchiko train station so I personally don‚Äôt think a tour is worth it, there‚Äôs also a tourist information desk with really helpful staff at the station.","I wish more people would format their itinerary like yours. Haha.

Anyway, November 9th, slot in Yanaka Ginza in Nippori before going to Ueno. It's two short stops from Ueno. I say go there before because their shops close at 5 p.m.

For the Kawaguchiko/Mt. Fuji day trip, I think you should just do it on your own instead of a tour, unless the tour also includes Chureito Pagoda too, or other surrounding areas, then maybe the tour is better.

EDIT: Also, if you haven't already booked your hotel, I would recommend staying at Ueno since there is a limited express train that goes straight to NRT from Ueno station. This will allow you to slowly explore Ueno and have time for parts of Tokyo. Ueno is a good vibe at night IMO.","I‚Äôm always a bit confused about itineraries where people go to Omoide Yokocho on their first night in Japan. It might have changed since I was last there, but it‚Äôs not particularly accessible to tourists as it‚Äôs mainly a place for locals to have a drink or quick dinner after work. What do you mean by exploring it? It‚Äôs a couple of alleys with small bars and food shops.

If you only have 3 full days in Tokyo I wouldn‚Äôt recommend a day trip to see Mount Fuji given the uncertainty over whether you‚Äôll see it given it‚Äôs often hidden by cloud: if you want to do a day trip Kamakura is an easy option. You could also spend a day in the incredibly interesting city rather than go to a generic Disney theme park, but prioritise what interests you if that‚Äôs Disney.

The Tsukiji Outer Market is a pretty underwhelming and touristy place. Again, I suspect that you can do something more interesting with your time.","It's good to see the sunset and night view from Tokyo Skytree so you might want to include that in your nov 9 activities after Sumida river. Also, not sure if you already purchased your ticket to Tokyo Disneyland, but better buy it online for easy entry. Then some tips, try to hit the headliners first right after the opening then do the popular family rides next. If you need to eat try to time it during off-peak hours cause waiting lines can be long for food stalls.",
1n88da6,Dad + 5 year old - Solo parent travel!,"Hi All, Just looking for some ideas for taking a 5 year old to Osaka and Kyoto. Don‚Äôt worry, very well behaved kid üòÖ. Loves Japanese food and pretty good for big walks (sure he will be on my shoulders for some!) and public transport. We are also doing some basic language and customs as he has Japanese teachers at Kindy.

Day 1 - explore dontonbori, round1 stadium, sumo hall show (any recommended other spots close to these that are musts with a 5 year old boy?) 

Day 2 - namba yasaka, kaiyukan aquarium, Legoland, Osaka castle 

Day 3 - day trip Nara, maybe teamlab Nagai at night (has anyone been? Worth the effort?) 

Day 4 - off to Kyoto but in no rush so could do something in the morning in Osaka. Afternoon tandem Bike hire and ride around Higashiyama and Gion district. 

Day 5 - Arishiyama and Monkey Park 

Day 6 - Nishiki Market, Train museum, Nijo castle, any recommended Kyoto arcades? 

Day 7 - Fushimi Inari, Kiyomizudera,

Happy for any recommended cool food spots, pet cafes, better gaming spots, children‚Äôs playgrounds/parks in Osaka (staying near Osaka-Namba Station) and Kyoto (staying near Kyoto Station)! Supportive solo parent travel tips welcome. 

PS For anyone worried about walking distances with child, we are not locked in everything, these are just options to consider üòÇ if we‚Äôre exhausted we won‚Äôt do something ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è I‚Äôm learning people on Reddit can be very strange.

Thanks! ‚ò∫Ô∏è ",https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1n88da6/dad_5_year_old_solo_parent_travel/,"I will just say that Japan is a lot of walking, and many times it's more efficient to walk, so be prepared to lug your kid around. Haha. If you're bringing a stroller, it can still be a challenge if you've never traveled with one in a city that has trains.

All I have to say is good luck and enjoy.

EDIT: I think the monkey park at Arashiyama is a hilly walk. Probably best to avoid unless you have strong knees to carry your kid.

EDIT 2: Also, reformat your itinerary because it's jumbled up and hard to read.","I lived in Osaka and my kids loved  Kidz Plaza, also  close by is the Osaka Museum of Housing and Living,   My daughters got a chance to wear a yukata there and they liked it.   Between those two spots there  is a covered shopping arcade, which is one of the longest in Japan.  I always got a crepe there, it is near JR Tenma.  There are also plenty of small restaurants that serve Okonomi yaki,  tako-yaki and such foods.   This area is just a bit north of Umeda.  In Umeda, ride the the Hep Plaza Ferris Wheel.

When you are in Nara Park, you can rent a row boat.  My kids loved that.

kaiyukan aquarium -  The whale there is pretty impressive, but if  there are aquariums near your hometown, I would skip it.  Looking at fish, isn't much of a Japanese experience.

Tsurumi Ryokuchi Pool -  This was always fun for my kids.  There is a wave pool that is open year round.

About taking your son on a tandem bicycle..  I wouldn't ride on the streets of Kyoto.. it is a busy city especially near the tourist spots.  I would only ride where there aren't any cars.

I think your son might get bored of Arashiyama..",,,

",https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1n7tx07/honeymoon_itinerary_feedback_for_this_november/,"I did not enjoy seeing the deer in nara, the main area with the deer is not very nice.  overcrowded with deer and tourists, poo everywhere, deer dont look happy or healthy, tourists ocassionally harrassing deer   

nara itself is a different story, but just be prepared that if you are an animal lover you will feel sad after seeing the deer

also everyone is different,  but I feel your itinerary is a bit overpacked  especially given its your honeymoon.  might be  nice to do more of the couply stuff eg a nice stay in a ryokan with private outdoor onsen.   you can also book private onsent in public bath houses, apparently these are better than the in room onsens.  

a lot of the tourist tickbox stuff is hugely over rated imo.  shibuya crossing... is just a crossing.... if you want to see tokyo night sky or general skyline you are better off going to one of the nice high floor hotel bars.  I think the grand hyatt is open again now for example.  also ebisu tower has great views from top floor windows, also some great restaurants.  these are much better option than the nightmare of trying to book shibuya sky.","This looks ok, other than the rather unrealistic first day and much too busy second day. Some other days seem rather busy but might be doable. I‚Äôd suggest having backup plans for bad weather given it often rains in Japan.

I‚Äôd suggest adding time to Hiroshima rather than going to Kobe, which doesn‚Äôt look as interesting. Himeji castle is also a popular stopover on this leg of Golden Route trips.",,,

Day 9 Tokyo

Flight back Home to US (HND)",https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1n7rw0v/itinerary_review_v01_jp/,Plot Day 2 out on google maps - it's kind of all over the place. I'd at the very least reorder that day.,"I would suggest heading to Kyoto after landing in Japan, and put all your Tokyo days at the end of the trip. It'll condense your hotel accommodations. Less packing and checking in.

Also, instead of doing one night in Osaka, just do a day trip from Kyoto because of the same reasoning I mentioned above.

For a short trip, you don't want to constantly check into a new hotel. Two hotel accommodations in a span of 8 full days is better than 4.","Day 2 is somewhat all over the place. Go very early to Sensoji to get the best views before it becomes absolutely packed in the morning. From there, know what time your teamlab reservation is and how long it will take to get to and from it. You can probably do Akihabara in the late afternoon still, but you should have an idea of the specific places and things to do there. I‚Äôd skip the temple and just enjoy what you already have. 

On that note, for day 3, do you have anything else you actually want to do in Shibuya? The crossing really just is a crosswalk full of tourists. It‚Äôs a cool idea to think about how busy it is with people all around the world, but nothing all that special in person. You just cross the street. Better to cross it when you are going somewhere specific. I‚Äôm not sure what you plan to do in Shinjuku, but both of these cities are enormous. Might want to plot out why exactly you‚Äôre going. 

If you go to Kyoto, it‚Äôs much harder to ‚Äúwait and see‚Äù for things like food and activities. When I was there last, everything was crammed full of tourists and had no openings. Research ahead and reserve tables where possible, or plan to wait almost two hours for simple conveyor belt sushi. It‚Äôs fine, just not ideal haha.","If you haven't bought your bullet train tickets yet, I would look into just taking one of their airlines between Tokyo and Kyoto. Unless you really just wanna take the train. The flight time is roughly only 30 minutes between the two cities, while the train is about 4 hours. And as someone else suggested I would go out to Osaka and Kyoto immediately when you arrive and then come back to Tokyo at the end of your trip.",
1n7nuhb,2 Week Itinerary Feedback,"Hi guys, I‚Äôm looking for some insight/feedback on how I‚Äôve planned out our itinerary for a 2 week trip to Japan (we‚Äôll have 12 full days to explore)! There‚Äôs 3 of us going, myself, wife and brother. We are all vegetarian. I don‚Äôt want to be rushed during the trip, but also do want to see a lot so trying to find a happy medium between the two. We are going mod to late November. From what I‚Äôm reading, sunset in Japan is at around 4:30pm, so that will play a factor into how we should structure the days. 
So far, I‚Äôve booked hotels (most if not all have cancellation policies), Tea Ceremony in Kyoto, and a ramen cooking class in Tokyo. All of these can be cancelled/adjusted as well if need be.
If you think things can be done better or have suggestions on anything, please feel free to share! Appreciate any input on our plans! Thank you!

Day 1:
Arrival in Haneda at 6pm. Get food and get some rest somewhere near the Tokyo train station. 

Day 2:
7:00am Train to Osaka from Tokyo
9:30am Reach Osaka, leave bags at hotel
Explore Dontonbori until 2:30pm
3:00pm See Osaka Castle (There is an Uverworld concert going on nearby that we are trying to get tickets to, but not likely as we are foreigners - maybe we can just hang outside the venue and hear them from afar and grab some food)
Pretty much just keep exploring Osaka from this point on, Dontonbori, PARCO, 2nd Street, Doguyasuji shopping street
Hotel is in Umeda (reason is it‚Äôs cheaper, quieter, and gives us a reason to walk around this area as well)

Day 3:
Half day trip to Nara - no particular time to end, but want to reach Nara around 7:30am
Want to see Todaiji, Nara Park, Higashimuki shopping street, Natkatanidou, Salon Naramachi Cafe, Kasugataisha (optional)

From here we can spend the second half of the day in Osaka if we feel like there is more to be explored, or we get a head start on Kyoto. Back to hotel in Umeda to sleep.

Day 4:
Take early train from Osaka to Kyoto and leave bags at Arashiyama Station
8:00am Togetsukyo Bridge 
9:00am Take Sagano Scenic train to Kameoka
9:30am Hozugawa Boat Ride
12:30pm Lunch maybe at Tenryuji temple/shigetsu or Sagano-yu cafe
1:00pm Kinkakuji - we‚Äôd take a taxi to get there and back to Arashiyama station
2:00pm Check in hotel near Kyoto station and drop off bags
3:00pm Nishiki market and Poncho alley for remainder of night

From what I‚Äôm reading, Nishiki Market shops start to close at 5:00pm. Is this itinerary enough time to spend time in Nishiki market area if we take the train back to Kyoto station to drop our bags? I know there is a bus that goes straight from Kinkakuji to Nishiki market, would this be better? If we do this, where do we store our bags? Day 5:
6:30am Fushimi Inari at sunrise
9:00am Tea Ceremony at Maikoya Nishiki Market reservations
10:30am Pancakes at Kumonocha Cafe
Soak it in and enjoy the area if we missed anything from yesterday
1:00pm Sannenzaka/Ninenzaka
3:45pm Head to Kiyomizudera for sunset
6:00pm Kodaiji at night time with illumination
Spend remainder of night at Kiyamachi-dori or Gion or just by the Ina River

Day 6:
7:15am Shinkansen to Mishima, get there at 10:00am
10:30am Get a rental car, and grab some snacks
11:00am Be on our way to Kawazu Seven Waterfalls with some stops along the way
So sunset is at 4:30pm, and I want to do this hike while it‚Äôs still daylight and enjoy the Amagiso public onsen nearby. Plan on hitting the following on the way down, we don‚Äôt plan to stop too long at any of these: Ichigo Plaza in Minamiema for food, drive by Wasabi Fields of Ikadaba, Joren Falls, Old Amagi Tunnel North Side (Can I drive through this??)
After the Waterfalls, we can check out the Uehara Museum, and spend the rest of the night in Shimoda and explore. 
We are staying at a hotel in Shimoda

Day 7:
We see the west coast of Izu
7:00am Get up early and see Shimoda in the daylight
9:00am Leave on our drive along west coast
No particular time frame for the places we want to see but we need to wrap up by 4:00pm. Plan to see Kumomi Sengen Shrine, Dogashima Cave (we will be doing a tour, I think they are only 20 minutes long), Koganezaki Park, Lover‚Äôs Cape Gold Bell, and Mihama Beach and get Mt. Fuji views. 
End the night at Arai Ryokan in Shuzenji and explore the area after sunset (5:00pm onwards).

Day 8:
5:00am Leave for Kawaguchiko
6:00am Arrive at Kawaguchiko and see Mt. Fuji
9:00am There is a bus from Kawaguchiko to Tokyo that we are planning on taking. The Toyota car rental offers pickup in Mishima and drop-off in Kawaguchiko according to their website, but will have to confirm. This is a 2 hour bus to Tokyo and maybe a 15-20 min train to Asakusa.
1:00pm Explore Asakusa and Akihabara
Some places of interest: Sensoji, Nakamise Street, Animate
8:00pm Take Shinkansen to Nagano
10:00pm Arrive in Nagano and go to hotel to sleep 

Day 9:
9:00pm Togakushi Shrine 
There is a Soba Festival going on on this day (Nov 23rd) that we‚Äôd love to participate in!
12:00pm Zenkoji Temple
We would get dinner at Zenkoji Temple as well
Explore Nakamise shopping street until 4:30pm
6:00pm Watch fireworks from Saigawa Ryokuhci Park
After this, head back into town if there is any bar/place to drink sake. Then head back to hotel

Day 10:
No real timeline for this day
We go to Jigokudani Monkey Park in the morning to see the monkeys. 
Then go to our Shibu Onsen Ryokan and enjoy the baths/walking around/exploring. 
Dinner would be at the ryokan, I heard this place accommodates vegetarian/vegan meals! 

Day 11:
No real timeline for this day
We would make our way back to Tokyo
Stop by in Ikebukuro probably around 11:00am. I‚Äôd like to try the Ain Soph Soar restaurant (I read Ain Soph Ripple closed). Plan to see: Animate, Sunshine City mall, K-Books.
We are staying near Shinjuku Station, closer to Higashi-Shinjuku, for the remainder of the trip in Tokyo. We‚Äôd make our way there after we are done in Ikebukuro.

Day 12:
Planning to do some major shopping this day for anime/culture/kitchen/beauty/skin care items. 
9:00am Arrive in Shibuya Station
10:00am Check out Magnet by Shibuya109, and then go to Shibuya109
12:00pm Shibuya Parco, Uniqlo and GU if time
2:00pm Shibuya Center-Gai Street
3:30pm Get in line for Shibuya Sky Tower to see views at sunset 
5:00pm Get out of the tower and take the train to Harajuku station
6:00pm Get a small drink at Maccha House and head to Vegan Bistro Jangara for dinner
7:30pm Check out Harry Potter Shop
From here we can explore either Takeshita Street or Cat Street and Don Quijote late night
There is a bar I‚Äôd like to hit up as well called Bar Ishinohana.

Day 13:9:00am Shinjuku Station
9:30am Get breakfast at Sarabeth‚Äôs in Lumine
10:30am Reach Shin-Okubo
Explore Shin-Okuba until 12:00-1:00pm
1:00pm Come back to Shinjuku Station 
We can shop around here if we feel it
Explore Shinjuku until 3:30pm
4:00pm Get to Omoide Yokocho for sunset
Explore this area, make way back to Shunjuku to explore at night
Can hit up Golden Gai for drinks later

Day 14:
We can see Meiji Shrine in the morning if we are up early enough
We have reservations for a vegan ramen cooking class from 10:00am to 1:00pm
Leave for the Haneda Airport at 1:00pm
Wrap up remaining gifts/shopping at airport before we leave",https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1n7nuhb/2_week_itinerary_feedback/,This feels like a lot of places for that period of time.

A lot of your other days are hugely over crowded and you have not factored in travel times or human fatigue issues.

Unless you have deep religious beliefs, you will also fairly quickly get sick of visiting temples, especially if you manage to visit up to 10 of them in a day! There‚Äôs lots of other things you can see in Japan. For instance the various branches of the national museum if you have an interest in Japanese culture and art.","Drop the times because they aren't achievable. You don't know how much everything is going to take and you certainly won't be able to walk between shrines/temples, sightsee and get your goshuin in half an hour.



Also, unless you're the biggest fan of temples in history, you're gonna get bored to death with that itinerary.


Drop stuff or leave temples/shrines as optionals and add variety.",,,

1n7nxe5,Help with my Kyoto itinerary,"Hi! I am going to Japan for 20 days at the end of November, and I am putting together my itinerary little by little. Today I would love to get some tips about Kyoto. I will be staying for 3 nights, and right after that I am heading to Osaka.

It would make more sense to go to Nara first on Day 1 before going to Kyoto IMO. This way you're only paying for 2 nights at the Kyoto hotel instead of 3. Unless you're doing it that way because those are the only days available for you at the ryokan.",,,,
1n77kn3,"Struggling to organize my Japan travel plans, looking for suggestions on route and timing","Hi everyone,

I‚Äôm planning a trip to Japan (coming from India) and would really appreciate help in finalizing my itinerary. I have a bunch of places and interests in mind, but I‚Äôm struggling to put them in the right order and figure out the best base cities and day trips.

Here‚Äôs what I have so far:

# Arrival:

I‚Äôll be landing in **Osaka**.

# Places I definitely want to visit:

# Osaka:

* Osaka Castle (mainly for the autumn foliage)
* Kuromon Ichiba Market
* Namba Shrine
* Umeda area (for Pok√©mon Center and Nintendo store)
* Universal Studios

# Hiroshima:

* Itsukushima Shrine and Miyajima Island

# Nara:

* I'd like to visit Nara, but not for the deer park. I‚Äôm more interested in the historical/cultural side.

# Kamakura and Shizuoka:

* I‚Äôd like to do day trips to both, but I‚Äôm unsure if I should stay in those towns or visit from nearby hubs like Tokyo or Yokohama.

# Mount Fuji area:

* I‚Äôm not planning to hike, but I‚Äôd love to get some great views of Mount Fuji. Places like Chureito Pagoda, Fujisan Yume No ≈åhashi Bridge, or the famous Lawson with the view are on my list.
* Open to suggestions for scenic spots that are accessible and don‚Äôt require intense walking.
* I know visibility depends on weather, so I‚Äôd also appreciate any tips for maximizing my chances of seeing Fuji clearly.

# Tokyo:

* I know this city has a lot to offer, but also can be expensive. Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôm most interested in other than the obvious places:
   * Pok√©mon Centers (not sure which ones are worth visiting, any recommendations?)
   * TeamLabs Borderless
   * The Making of Harry Potter Studio Tour
   * Disneyland and DisneySea (Would I need two full days, or can both be done in one?)

# Other experiences I‚Äôm interested in (location flexible):

These don‚Äôt have to be in Tokyo. I‚Äôm happy to include them anywhere that makes sense logistically.

* Watch a **sumo match** (if there's one happening during my trip)
* **Traditional onsen** experience
* Watch a **volleyball match** (national, university, or even local, anything fun to attend)
* Visiting **Kasukabe City** (Shin-chan‚Äôs hometown): does this make sense as a fan?

# Travel window:

I‚Äôm choosing between two time windows:

* **Mid October to end of October**
* **From 8th November onwards**

Which one would you recommend in terms of weather and avoiding huge crowds?

# What I need help with:

1. What‚Äôs the most efficient **route/order** to visit these places?
2. For places like Kamakura, Nara, Shizuoka, etc., is it better to **stay overnight** or do **day trips** from a nearby city?
3. How many days should I ideally spend in each major area?
4. Any tips to help structure this trip in a way that‚Äôs exciting but not exhausting?
5. Hiroshima is kind of a secluded location on the west side of the map, can I include anything else on that side?

Thanks in advance for any help! I know this is a lot, but I‚Äôm super excited and just want to make the most of my time while keeping things realistic.

  
**TL;DR:**  
Planning a Japan trip (landing in Osaka) with interests in Pok√©mon, tech, Mount Fuji views, and theme parks. Not into hiking or food. Main places I want to visit: Osaka, Hiroshima, Nara (other than deer park), Mount Fuji area, Tokyo, Kamakura, and Shizuoka.

Also hoping to fit in: sumo match, onsen, volleyball game, and maybe Kasukabe (Shin-chan city).

Need help with:

* Best route/order to visit these spots
* Whether to do day trips or stay overnight in places like Nara, Kamakura, Shizuoka
* Choosing between two travel windows: mid to end October **vs.** starting Nov 8 (which has better weather and fewer crowds?)
* General tips to avoid burnout while covering everything efficiently",https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1n77kn3/struggling_to_organize_my_japan_travel_plans/,">the famous Lawson with the view

Just don't. Locals are fed up with tourists going to this Lawson just to get pics because it's led to idiots crossing the street haphazardly. They tried putting up a tarp, and people just poked holes in it. There's actual tourist sites where you can get views of Mt. Fuji.","1. You look at where these are on a map and go to the ones that are closest to each other.

2.  Look up how long it takes to get to those places. If it‚Äôs short then you can day trip.  Short in my world is less than2 hours.

3.  Depends on what you‚Äôre seeing.

4. Fukuoka but you also don‚Äôt say how much time you have total, so you might already be pushing it to the point where you shouldn‚Äôt be adding anymore.

5.  Gets cooler closer towards November.  Google historical weather in Japan.

Don‚Äôt try to reinvent the wheel.  There are thousands of itineraries posted here that cover exactly what you have.","I've been using Wanderlog to plan my trip and it's been a great tool to vizualize where things are and the routes, so I've been able to reorganize my schedule of stops based on this information.","Actual sumo matches are extremely hard to get tickets for. I would recommend looking into sumo experiences or club demonstrations instead. Just as fun, but not a formal match like you see on TV.",
1n75rsb,Itinerary check for Kyoto and Tokyo early October,"Solo 42M travelling to Japan for the first time in a few weeks. I've wanted to do this for 20+ years and definitely not intending it to be the only time so this is intended to be a little bit of everything in the small time I have available. There's heaps to see and soak in but I also want time to just be in places.

I'm sure most of it is the usual tourist stuff and that's fine, it is what it is. But I also hope I've left enough room to just explore along the way sometimes.

There's a few things on my wishlist that I haven't slotted in yet and maybe won't even have the time to do but any suggestions about that would be very appreciated. They are seeing sumo, fancy omakase, cooking class, taiko drum class, teamLabs, baseball and #1 is karaoke which I'd really love to do with a group.

Fuji. You can look at it and the weather to kind of predict if you'll be able to see Fuji on the day that you plan to go. If Fuji is visible, do the boat ride across Lake Kawaguchi and do it as early as possible.

I will always suggest Yanaka Ginza in Nippori before noon, and dinner on Ameyoko street in Ueno. You could probably do Yanaka Ginza before you go to Ikebukuro. If Ghibli Museum doesn't pan out, then on Oct 12. do Asakusa -> Yanaka Ginza + other things in Nippori if you feel like it -> Ueno.",,,
1n7cei5,Itinerary check: 6 days in Okinawa with 3-year old and baby,"We are thinking of traveling to Okinawa in early November for our first international travel as a family of four. Two years ago, we spent a week in Toyko with our then 1-year old and had a great time. We'd be very grateful if anyone has feedback on our travel itinerary :) 

We will be flying from Taiwan and renting a car at the airport. We've never been to Okinawa before so we would love to visit the bigger must-see tourist attractions while also keeping the schedule relaxed and flexible enough for the kids. 

Day 1:  
Naha  
Kokusai Street   
Tsuboya Pottery District

Day 2:  
Okinawa World  
Gyokusendo Cave

Day 3:  
American Village and Araha Beach Playground  
Ryukyu Mura or Southeast Botanical Gardens  
  
Day 4:  
Churaumi Aquarium  
Ocean Expo Park

Day 5:  
Nago Pineapple Park  
Aeon Mall 

Day 6:  
Shuri Castle (I've read that it's still worth to visit the castle grounds despite it not being open yet. Is that correct?)  
Naha

Would you say it's worthwhile to see both Okinawa World and Ryukyu Mura? Should we swap or leave something out?   
Any child-friendly restaurant or hotel recommendations? We'll probably try and book two hotels, one further south and one further north to keep the driving times more manageable for the kids. Your input would be greatly appreciated, thank you!

I‚Äôll be renting a car and have drafted a preliminary itinerary. Please let me know if it‚Äôs feasible/any suggestions on best places to view autumn leaves. Thank you!

18th Oct: 
1. Arrive in New Chitose airport around 2pm.
2. Collect rental car from airport and drive to Jozankei Onsen area. Side note: is renting a car directly from the airport advisable? Or should we travel to Sapporo city first to collect the car so it would be cheaper?

19th Oct:
1. Travel around Jozankei Onsen area - view autumn leaves from Futamitsuri Bridge. Other places of interest: Kappabuchi Pool, Akaiwa-no-Kan stream
2. Travel to Mt Hakkenzan

20th Oct:
1. Drive to Lake shikotsu
2. Drive to Mt Tarumae
3. Drive to Noboribetsu, visit Hell‚Äôs valley. Side note: I‚Äôm not exactly sure if I want to visit Noboribetsu as I‚Äôve been there before in the winter. I didn‚Äôt find it particularly beautiful/interesting but I‚Äôm not sure about autumn. However there aren‚Äôt any major towns to stay in close to lake shikotsu. Any advice/suggestions?

21th Oct:
1. Drive to Furano
2. Visit Farm Tomita, Panorama Road
3. Drive to Biei
4. Visit Shirogane Blue Pond and Shirahige waterfall
5. Drive to Asahikawa to stay for the night

22nd Oct:
1. Drive to Daisetsuzan Sounkyo Kurodake ropeway.
2. Take ropeway up
3 Visit Ryusei waterfalls and Momijidaki waterfalls
4. Travel back to Asahikawa for the night

23rd Oct:
1. Drive to Otaru
2. Temiya Botanical garden
3. Need some more suggestions for Otaru! 

24th Oct:
1. Drive to Sapporo
2. Return the car
3. Visit Hokkaido university
4. Nakajima park

25th Oct:
1. Travel to the airport to depart.


Some other questions I have: 

1. Would it be easy to find free parking spots in hotels in Asahikawa/Noboribetsu/Otaru? Parking seems expensive in Sapporo hence I‚Äôm inclined to return the car and rely on public transport when in Sapporo.

2. How is driving like in Hokkaido? We are not very used to driving long distance so I‚Äôm worried the drive to Furano might be tiring.

3. Would the tourist spots be crowded during the time period I‚Äôll be there? 

Thanks in advance! ",https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1n7fgag/hokkaido_road_trip_to_view_autumn_leaves/,"I have a somewhat similar itinerary. If you only got only one week in Hokkaido I'd reconsider all this travelling around, might more sense to focus on the area around Sapporo and south-west from it. Furano will probably be quite sad with most flowers gone already.

there might be some better deals if you compare with the official website with third-party ones
(here are some that i looked at:

(times by the airport looks quite convenient since it has a direct bus to the shop from the airport)

depending on the number of people and the number of luggages you will have, the price will differ but i do recommend renting a car nearby the airport. with all the luggages to lug around, it might be better for you and your family ü§î

# Questions:

* Is Senjogahara hiking worth in Early October? I know no red leaves there at that time.
* teamLab Planets vs Borderless - worth it?

Thanks!",https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1n79ygm/itinerary_check_8_days_in_nikko_tokyo_2nd_timer/,"If you're in Nikko for two days, I highly reccomend checking out the Kanmangafuchi Abyss. If you like contemporary art, Mori Art Museum is great.","TeamLab Planets, if you want a set path that guides you through the exhibit, and more physical interaction, like walking in water. Borderless if you want no set path and a bigger environment to explore and take your time. Honestly, you will only enjoy it if you like art and creativity. My husband was not a fan. I only enjoyed some aspects of it as an artist myself. There were A LOT of people who got there just for Instagram photos, so it kind of takes away from the experience as they get in the way a lot. Show up 1 hour early as well because there will be a huge line to get in, even before your time window. They will cut you off if you are late in any way.",,,

I‚Äôd recommend one full day there so two nights. On the full day you could go for a hike, there is a really nice trail on the outside of town that passes all kinds of temples and then goes on the mountain side. It takes a couple of hours. It would be hard to do on the same day as visiting the town and its shops, as those don‚Äôt have super long opening hours. Especially if that is also a day you are traveling in or out of Takayama. I would remove that ‚Äòrevisit‚Äô day in Tokyo, and spend the time on Takayama. It really is a lovely place. 

On Yanaka: I‚Äôve been there twice because people keep raving on how cute it is, but both times I was there there was barely a shop open in the main street and I found the surrounding area quite boring. There are definitely other areas that give you more bang for your buck timewise.","Why not do takayama between kyoto and tokyo? This is what i did last year: train to matsumoto, stay 1 night, nohi bus to takayama, 2 nights, one day trip to shirakawago, but i recommend takayama‚Äôs showa-kan musuem, then train to kyoto.","This looks so fun! I did some very similar Tokyo days on my first trip, it looks like it could be busy if you want it to be, but the lack of scheduled/times activities makes it very flexible if you decide to spend less/more time in a place. Highly recommend Takayama, it's one of my favorite places I've visited in Japan (second only to Ito). I loved walking the river and the old district in the morning, the architecture is beautiful in both the historical areas and the rest of the city. Just keep an eye on the train availability when leaving Takayama as they don't run super late into the evening.",Tokyo-Takayama-Kyoto makes more sense. Lots of backtracking in the current setup.,

1n6rw2d,Please give me feedback on my Itinerary: First time in Japan for 17 days,"Hello everyone,

I would be really happy if you could have a look at my itinerary for my first trip to Japan. I wonder if my plans are to ambitious (I'm aware that Day 11 + 12 in Kyoto will be stressful, because I have reservations stacked on those days).

My main focus is on shrines, temples, gardens, Kimono experiences, experiencing Geiko/Maiko as much as much as possible. And I would like to collect goshuin, stamps and souvenirs at shrines. And eventhough I like shopping for cute things, I would skip some shopping (Day 5 +6) for a cute/beautfil shrine.  Maybe you can recommend something to me? I even thought about leaving Tokyo one day earlier to have more time in Kyoto.

And do you think it will be possible to enjoy Nara on day 8 (if we start early) and still have time to arrive at Fushimi Inari before the stores on the grounds of the shrine close? Or do you think it would be better to start early at Fushimi Inari and then travel to Nara (open end) - and if we feel fancy, come back to Fushimi Inari the same day to experience it at night? I just would love to find a little quite place in Nara Park to interact with the deers alone, so I thought about arriving there really early.

Thanks in advance for any help and tips!

1n6u6zs,First Time in Japan,"Hey everyone!

My girlfriend and I are planning our first trip to Japan and we‚Äôre super excited. We'll be in Japan from December 29th, 2025, and currently planning to leave, sometime between January 17th and 24th, flying in and out of Tokyo Narita. We‚Äôre looking for some feedback on our itinerary, and especially advice on whether it‚Äôs worth extending our trip by a few extra days (3‚Äì6 days) and where to go if we do.

We are traveling by train only (no car), and we‚Äôre not interested in skiing. We do enjoy scenic spots, traditional culture, and some light urban exploring. We‚Äôd love to see some **winter landscapes**, especially towns or cities with snow, but ideally not something that requires super long travel days. We don‚Äôt plan to visit **Sapporo** this time due to the distance for such a short stay.

Current Itinerary (18 Days)

Day 1‚Äì5 (Dec 29‚ÄìJan 2): Tokyo

* Arrival in Tokyo
* Exploring Shibuya, Shinjuku, Shibuya Sky, teamLab Borderless
* New Year‚Äôs Day: Hatsumode experience
* Day trip to Nikko (Jan 2)

Day 6‚Äì7 (Jan 3‚Äì4): Nagano

* Snow monkeys at Jigokudani
* Zenko-ji Temple
* Enjoying the snow and winter atmosphere

Day 8 (Jan 5): Kanazawa

* Kenroku-en Garden, Omicho Market, Higashi Chaya District

Day 9‚Äì12 (Jan 6‚Äì9): Kyoto

* Fushimi Inari, Arashiyama Bamboo Grove, Kinkaku-ji, Gion
* Day trip to Nara

Day 13‚Äì16 (Jan 10‚Äì13): Osaka

* Dotonbori, Osaka Castle, Shinsekai
* Day trips to Uji, Kobe (maybe), and Hiroshima / Onomichi (Jan 13)

Day 17‚Äì18 (Jan 14‚Äì15): Mount Fuji (Kawaguchiko)

* Staying near Lake Kawaguchi
* Hoping for clear views of Fuji, relaxing in a ryokan/onsen


Looking to Extend ‚Äì Need Suggestions

We‚Äôre considering adding 3 to 6 more days before we fly back from Tokyo. Initially we were thinking about Takayama, but coming from Mount Fuji it seems like a long train trip, especially in winter. I've also read mixed opinions about whether Takayama is worth more than a short stay.

What we're looking for:

* Somewhere scenic or traditional with winter vibes
* Easy to reach by train from Mount Fuji or Tokyo
* Not super touristy or overly time-consuming to reach

We‚Äôve ruled out Sapporo for this trip due to time constraints and distance.

Questions:

1. Is Takayama worth the long trip from Kawaguchiko, especially if we only plan to stay 1‚Äì2 nights? Would you recommend it over just staying in Tokyo longer or going somewhere else?
2. Any suggestions for winter towns/cities that are easier to reach and worth visiting without skiing?
3. Is Shirakawa-go realistic without a car in winter, especially if not paired with Takayama?
4. Would Hakone be redundant after Kawaguchiko, or could it still offer something new?
5. Any less-discussed spots that offer a cozy winter atmosphere and can be visited by train?


Other Considerations:

* We're already doing Tokyo, Kyoto, Osaka, Kanazawa, and Hiroshima, so ideally looking for something a bit different for the extension.
* We're okay with more time in Tokyo at the end, but would love to explore one last place if it‚Äôs worth it.
* Traveling exclusively by train (we do have the JR Pass).
* We don't ski or snowboard.


Thanks in advance for reading! Any feedback, suggestions, or advice would be really appreciated. Especially if you‚Äôve traveled during winter and have a favorite cozy place or snowy town that‚Äôs easy to get to. üòä

",https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1n6u6zs/first_time_in_japan/,I‚Äôd suggest staying for at least a night in Hiroshima: it‚Äôs a great city and there‚Äôs lots to do there. A day trip would be rather hectic and you have plenty of time¬†,A lot of places will be closed around New years. Keep that in mind.,"Are the hotel dates locked in? Logistically, it would be more convenient to visit Shirakawa-go and Takayama between Kanazawa and Kyoto. 

It's super easy to get to Shirakawa-go from Kanazawa via highway bus (advanced reservation recommended). You could do it as a day trip or continue onwards by bus to Takayama. These towns can be pretty touristy but they're gorgeous in winter. There's a reason it's so popular.","Hakone is definitely beautiful and has a more small town atmosphere to it in my opinion, definitely worth checking out! There‚Äôs also a really famous and beautiful shrine gate on the water and mountain side there","If you're going to Kobe I would recommend

If anyone has any advice/recommendations (especially for Asakusa/Sengawa in Tokyo), please let me know!",https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1n6dhet/feedback_on_itinerary_octnov_25/,FYI Ghibli museum is closed at the beginning of November (4-18),"Woah - from Kewpie to the Museum is an hour of transit!  I guess you love some mayo! :D

Overall, you seem to have a very reasonable set of goals.  If you had the opportunity, you might do Himeji Castle over Osaka Castle.  Maybe do a bit more research around the less seen temples and shrines around Kyoto and put them on a ""maybe"" list in case you got through Kodaiji or you enjoyed the bamboo somewhere else?

You've got your tickets for Ghibli Park?","Day trip to Ghibli museum from Kyoto is really expensive. Have you checked the price of the train? You can spend a night near Ghibli or Nagoya.

You're visiting Asakusa on Day 3 and Senso-ji Temple again on Day 6? It's pretty much the same area.

What time is your return flight? I think you might have too many activities before your flight. There are many things to do at Osaka castle and it's not very close to Namba Yasaka Jinja.",When are you doing fushimi inari? Must see. Also skip imperial palace. Also you will have likely already been to senso Ji by day 6 if you‚Äôre staying in asakusa,
1n69y5h,2 days in Tokyo itinerary,"Hi all, I've posted about my itinerary previously which I had not really planned out fully so I've gone back to just planning each city for now. I'm a bit overwhelmed, and my trip is starting October 21st so I feel like I need to make some concrete plans soon..

So, I would love some opinions on my plan for Tokyo since we are only really spending 2 full days there. We have an evening and a morning to spend there as well. 

Just a note that we plan to have early starts and relatively late nights (which we are totally fine to do!).

Itinerary for Tokyo so far:

Oct 21:
Arrival at Narita airport around 7pm. We plan to just have something to eat and travel to our hotel in Shinjuku. Depending on energy levels and what time we get there, we might just wander around the nearby area, visit a 7/11 for snacks and have an early night.

Oct 22:
FULL DAY
I'm sticking to a triangle area of Shinjuku - Shimokitazawa - Shibuya - Shinjuku.
- Breakfast in Shinjuku
- Brunch and shopping in Shimokitazama
- Lunch in Shibuya
- Tower records and Ishibashi music in Shibuya
- Shibuya scramble and Shibuya sky
- Maybe get snacks and visit Yoyogi park/Meiji shrine if there's time
- back to Shinjuku for a rest and we want to get some street food and visit a few bars in the evening

Oct 23:
FULL DAY
- Breakfast with a friend in Shinjuku
- Teamlab borderless in Azadubai Hills
- Visit the nearby Don Quijote

Oct 24:
- Check out of hotel at 10am
- Travel day to our next hotel in Hakone (I want to arrive there by early afternoon if possible).

I would like some opinions of what things from Oct 22nd could be moved to the next day so its not so jam packed. My thinking was to keep things on a similar train line/nearby area together into one day. I'm open to see more museums or shrines as well but I'm not sure if I should be adding more to the itinerary at this point!

Just a side note that we are going back to Tokyo for a night/morning before heading back home and that hotel will be on Akihabara.

Any help would be appreciated! Thank you üòä 
",https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1n69y5h/2_days_in_tokyo_itinerary/,I‚Äôd skip teamlabs and head to Asakusa,"With a short trip like this, it‚Äôs best to have a goal of places to see over three days rather than try to break it down by day.   You can chuck in Nakano, Kichijoji, Miitaka as nearby locations, but really Ginza and the other side of Tokyo is only about 30 away.

I wouldn‚Äôt plan on early mornings.  Not much is open before 10am.  Although if you want the less claustrophobic Donki experience, you go before 10.","Are you guys into anime and manga? Akihabara has a lot of things for otaku's, like ONODEN, Mandarake Complex, and Gachapon Hall. If not, I would recommend checking Ginza, which is pretty close by. If you're looking for more up-scale dining, they have several sushi and wagyu restaurants that are worth trying. 

Another unique thing to check out is the Samurai Restaurant in Shinjuku. This is probably one of the most memorable places I went to in Tokyo. I was able to get discounted tickets on Pelago and wow. Their performances are something else. There are performers dressed up as samurais, mikoshi, and Japanese demons (? something folklore, I'm not to sure of the name). It's all linked to Japanese culture so it was definitely a fun way to learn about their folk legends.","For October 23rd

Asakusa -> Yanaka Ginza (shops close around 5 p.m.) + other spots in Nippori if you feel -> Ueno (eat dinner and drink up at Ameyoko street).",

",https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1n6poyg/help_with_my_itinerary/,Your timeslots are unrealistic imo but activities look fine.,"In Osaka, double-check that the shops you're interested in are open at 10am.  Mandarake, for example, doesn't open until noon!

While I don't have direct experience, Dontonbori during the day isn't going to be quite as exciting as by night with everything lit up.  Granted, the sun will set around 5:15, so it'll be close.  Americkamura also seems interesting in that general area.  

I'm sure it's on your mind, but the Ghibli tickets will go on sale in a couple of days.  You're probably already thinking this, but be flexible on which day you're aiming for the museum to increase you options.  You can swap a day around.

An hour in Kappabashi probably isn't enough if you're really looking/shopping.  There are so many stores and so many options...","You'll get knocked off your quarter-hour schedule almost instantly.

For your day 4, I would advise avoiding Gotokuji for three reasons: 1. It's not really a 'cat temple': it's just promoted as one by the local merchants' association. If you want a real cat place, go to the Imado Shrine (which you'll be near on your day one; 2. the Gotokuji area has lost most of its hitherto considerable charm and has become a line of mostly souvenir shops; 3. the actual Gotokuji closes at 5 PM.","Day 2 I do not like the order. As store do not open before 10-11am (some even 12 on weekday) Akihabara is not a good morning spot. Make more sense to do Kanda Myojin or even Nezu Shrine first. Also Shibuya is kind of odd on that day, especially when you go next to Shibuya next day (but guess you might not have time if you already have a lot of things planned.

Some days seems a bit unbalanced with some that have a bit too much and other too little. Just keep the itinerary as idea and feel free to move things around while visiting. Don't try to rush and see everything at all cost.

Osaka-Kyoto, you likely do not want ""reserved seats"", that would suggest you want to take the shinkansen. Instead check how to go to the first location from your hotel, the shinkansen is likely not the best way. I would remove the bamboo grove, if you just want to see bamboo, there is some at Fushimi Inari or go to Kodai-ji, that is close to Gion.",
1n62d43,Itinerary Feedback - 14 Day Trip October,"Hi. I'm looking for feedback on my itinerary for a 14-15 day trip. I would be arriving in mid October and leaving at the end of the month. This will be my first trip to Japan. I'm much more interested in seeing nature and also a bit of a ""slice of life"" in Japan than seeing all the popular tourist attractions, but I want the trip to be kind of balanced. I will be traveling solo. If anyone has any thoughts or suggestions it would be appreciated. I'm not sure if maybe I'm traveling around a bit too much. Maybe it would be better to focus on either the Hiroshima area OR the Nagano area and not both? What do you guys think?

Day 1:  
\- Land in Tokyo in the afternoon, check into hotel. I don't sleep well on planes so I'm not going to schedule anything specific. I will probably just walk around the area, have dinner, and go to sleep.

Day 2:  
\- Go to team labs borderless in the morning  
\- There is a lunch spot called Kaisuian that i want to check out it looks like a nice place to get an authentic lunch.  
\- After lunch, Shinjuku Gyoen National Garden

Day 3:

\- Take Shinkansen to Hiroshima

\- Hiroshima Castle & Hiroshima Museum of Art

Day 4:

\- Peace Museum and walk around the city

\- Shukkeien Garden

Day 5:

\- Take ferry to Miyajimi. Hike around the island and of course check out the shrine.

\- Stay the night at one of the ryokan on the island

Day 6:

\- Return to Hiroshima and taken Shinkansen to Nagoya

\- Check out Nagoya castle and the Samurai museums or maybe the art or science museums in the area. (I wasn't super interested in Nagoya but I want to go to Nagano and it seemed like a logical stopping point. Maybe it would make more sense to just go all the way to Nagano in one day though?)

Day 7:

\- Take train to Nagano

\- Zenkoji Temple & Nagano Prefecture Art Museum

Day 8:

\- Rent a car and take  a day trip to hike around Togakushi shrine.

Day 9:

\- Drive up to Lake Nojiri. Either hike around the lake or go kayaking if the weather is nice enough. (I might cut this from the trip, it just seems like a nice area so kind of wanted to see it.)

Day 10:

\- Drive to Azumino

\- Daio Wasabi Farm

\- Wander around the area a bit and stay in airbnb

Day 11:

\- Matsumoto Castle  
\- Matsumoto City Museum of Art  
\- Ishii Miso factory tour

Day 12/13:

\- Drive to Kamikochi - spend two days hiking around and staying at one of the ryokans.

Day 14:

\- Drive back to nagano, return car. Take train to Tokyo.

\- Check into hotel in Shibuya and check out some of the shopping areas in Shibuya.

Day 15:

\-Meiji Jingu

\-Shibuya Sky

Day 16: Fly home",https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1n62d43/itinerary_feedback_14_day_trip_october/,"Double-check your timing on Day 3.  That's a 4 hour ride between cities - getting to the castle and museum during their opening hours will be pretty tight.

Nagoya has the Tokugawa Art Museum which looks pretty cool, but again you need to consider the travel timeline versus the business hours timeline.  At the same time, pushing from end-to-end, you might end up in Nagano after restaurants close!

Overall the balance seems reasonable, just need to fine-tune the long travel days.",,,,

Flights are not booked yet so it's still kind of flexible, but planning to go mid january to mid february, as its cheaper and less crowded everywhere and I love snow.

So first determine that, pin everything in Maps and plan your days grouping those places geographically in each city. Then assign days to each place.

Just stay in Kyoto and do Osaka as a day trip. It's a 30 minute train ride.


Maps also literally tells you the exact travel times. You're gonna be using it during all of the trip.

What is good? What should I add or replace?

I am open to any feedback, suggestions, tips. Really anything you think of!

Thank you! 
",https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1n5xeqp/itinerary_feedback/,"Your itinerary looks really  full of great spots! Just one tip, Kyoto is actually quite compact, so 2 days is usually enough for the highlights. If you have extra time, I‚Äôd suggest a side trip to¬†Uji¬†(30 min away) . it‚Äôs the hometown of matcha  with Byodoin Temple, Ujigami Shrine, and lots of amazing matcha sweets.","You are likely vastly underestimating the time it takes to get around in Tokyo.

Taking your day 4 as an example. Last Wednesday (a weekday, not a crowded weekend), our family went to one small museum in Ueno (the Shitamachi Museum), then went to five shops in the Ameyoko shopping area. We had been to the museum several times before; we knew exactly where four of the five shops were‚Äîthe last shop we stopped in for about 4 minutes spontaneously‚Äîand exactly how to get to them without consulting maps; in four of the five shops we knew exactly what we wanted to buy and did not browse; we are all fluent in Japanese; I know the streets of Ueno well and did not have to use a map. We avoided the crowded Ueno Station. We did not stop for lunch. Nevertheless, just the little we did took from 9 AM to 12:30 PM. For someone inexperienced in Japan and (probably) going to one of the big museums in Ueno, this would be an all-day affair.",,,
1n5ugoi,Any advice on my Itinerary?,"Travelling to Japan for the first time, flights are booked already for January 2026.

Obviously we can change the daily itinerary even when we are there, we just wrote this down to have a general idea of what we wanna see through the trip. Flights can‚Äôt be changed, but hotels can.

It‚Äôs our first time in Japan, and we will stay in three cities (Tokyo - Kyoto - Osaka). 

Any recommendations are appreciated, here‚Äôs what we have so far:

~~~~TOKYO ~~~~

Day 1 - Arrive at NRT at 3pm. Straight to the hotel (Shinjuku). Chill evening around the area, golden gai, metropolitan building and maybe a go to a club after midnight 

Day 2 - Meji-Jingu / Gotonkuji Temple and the Shibuya area in general (pokemon centre, Nintendo Tokyo, the Shibuya Crossing, Takeshita Street, Shibuya Sky etc)

Day 3 - Senso-ji, Nakamise St, Tokyo skytree, Kameido Tenjin, the Sumidq City are in general

Day 4 - Imperial Palace, Tokyo Tower, Akihabara area (Animate etc) and Ginza

Day 5 - Ueno Park, Tokyo National Museum, TeamLab Planets and the Minato area in general

Day 6 - Shinkansen to Kyoto in the morning


~~~~KYOTO ~~~~


Day 6 - Arrive at Kyoto early, hotel located in Shimogyo ward. Nishiki Market, Yashaka Shrine, Shirakawa Canal etc

Day 7 - Arashiyama area to hike around, Kinkaku-Ji then back to the city and Nintendo Museum

Day 8 - Last day in Kyoto, walk around, getting lost, shopping and enjoying the last night

Day 9 - Train to Osaka in the morning

~~~~OSAKA ~~~~

Day 9 - Arrive at Osaka early, hotel located near Shin-Osaka Station.
Osaka Castle, Dotonbori, Umeda Sky building and Namba at night

Day 10 - Universal Studios Japan, full day there, then back to Osaka and spend the night out

Day 11 - Shitenn≈ç-Ji, Shinsekai area. Last shopping and a chill evening

Day 12 - Wake up early and head to KIX. Flight back

1n5q2gg,Nikko Itinerary Check,"Family of 4 (2 kids 5yo and 2yo) staying 3nights in Nikko from 15-18 Oct - wanted to get some opinions and advice on the planned itinerary.

We arrive after a red-eye flight at Narita at 8am on 15 Oct and have rented a car for the time we will be in Nikko. We will drive to Nikko from Narita, and I estimate with 2-3 stops along the way, we will get to Nikko at around 1pm.

Here's the plan:

15 Oct:

1pm: Arrive at Nikko and visit Toshogu Shrine

5pm: Have dinner - any suggestions for must-eat restaurants?

16 Oct:

9am: Set out for Lake Chuzenji, and spend day there, visiting Akechidaira Ropeway, Kegon Falls, Lake Chuzenji Area, Senjogahara Marshland

4pm: Leave Lake Chuzenji area and drive back to Nikko

17 Oct:

9am: Head to Edo Wonderland

3pm: Private onsen at Akebi Onsen

4pm: Leave and back to Nikko town to explore some street food

I understand the Autumn Festival is happening on 16 and 17 Oct, and it will be extremely crowded, hence I scheduled our Toshogu Shrine visit for 15 Oct despite having arrived from a red eye flight - while I would love to explore the shrine complex, I have a feeling my kids won't really enjoy it so I expect to be there only 1-2hours (and have also not planned in visiting all the other temples and shrines :( ) I wonder if it is much of a pity to miss the Autumn Festival? We will have a stroller with a buggy board to seat both kids so I expect its probably going to be hard to navigate given how crowded it is during the festival.

Also, I have been reading lots of posts about how congested the drive up / down to Lake Chuzenji can be during autumn, are the timings I have posted for setting off / leaving fine, or would you suggest other timings for us to get up there and back, seeing as we are staying overnight in Nikko and have a car and are not limited by bus timings / train timings. Would the Autumn Festival taking place actually help to ease the crowds heading to Oku-Nikko on that day?

Happy to receive any other advice / pointers too. Thanks so very much!",https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1n5q2gg/nikko_itinerary_check/,"You‚Äôre probably worrying too much about crowds, just go and see. You‚Äôll have a lot of flexibility with 3 nights and a car. The festival is on weekdays so I don‚Äôt think it will be particularly overcrowded other than a lot of people just being there during the festival events. I doubt there will be insane traffic on a weekday. It‚Äôs a fall color spot so weekends are when everyone from the city goes there to clog up the roads.¬†",,,,

	2.	I now have Sept 25 as a free day in Osaka. Would you:
	‚Ä¢	Add one more day to Kyoto (more temples, maybe Fushimi Inari)?
	‚Ä¢	Give an extra day to Hiroshima (stay overnight in Miyajima)?
	‚Ä¢	Or even fit in a quick overnight in Fukuoka?
	3.	Any food spots or must-sees I‚Äôm missing near these areas?

Thanks a lot in advance!
",https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1n5efjl/thoughts_on_my_japan_itinerary_first_trip/,"I think your schedule is good, but I want to say about something.

First, you should choose optionB in 4th day, because Mt.Fuji is big area, so it needs a lot of time to look around there.

Second, Tokyo and Osaka‚Äôs train system is very big. So you have to search how to go your destination. especially Yamanote line in Tokyo, and Midosuji line in Osaka is very important. Both are also very useful I think. If you get lost, search‚Äù(station name) map‚Äù. That is may be help you.",def add a day to kyoto or move the nara trip to your osaka free day,"You can just take the subway from Kyoto to Osaka, you don't need to take the Shinkansen - it's more expensive and the Shin-Osaka station isn't that close to the places in Osaka you want to visit. 

I'd say Himeji castle is better than Osaka castle in all aspects, from size to history to crowds. I'd probably drop Osaka castle and visit another area in Osaka, maybe DenDen Town (had some really nice Surugaya and Mandarake finds there) or Amerikamura? Or is that planned for Day 16 already? 

Are your tickets for the Nintendo Museum already booked? They're sold by lottery, so if you didn't grab one already, I don't think you'll be able to. 

Kyoto vs Osaka is a lot of personal preference, but if this is your first trip, I'd use the free day in Osaka for Nara and maybe Uji, and add more temples in Kyoto, it's really nice, especially because serene areas where there's 5 other tourists were easy to find for me just by exploring the city.","Why would you take the shinkansen to Osaka? Have you looked at a map? It's like 30 minutes with a normal train.

You could even opt to not move hotels between Osaka/Kyoto because they're so close to each other.",

My main question is about Kawaguchiko ‚Äî I love the idea of seeing Mt. Fuji and the surrounding nature, but I‚Äôve read that traveling from Kawaguchiko to Kanazawa is quite time-consuming and complicated.

In the end we decided to do only a day trip to Kawaguchiko instead of spending the night so that the travel to Kanazawa is easier. 

I know it will be a tiring day as we plan to leave early. On the plus side, it also gives us a bit more flexibility to decide last minute in which day to go, so we can check the visibility forecast and decide accordingly",Rejig your itinerary. Go to kawaguchiko from Tokyo.,"I loved both Kawaguchiko and Kanazawa. We went to Nagano fron Kawaguchiko which was 4 hours. Since you‚Äôll be traveling to Kanazawa I would see the train ride as downtime. It‚Äôs 1 bus and 1 train, which is quite chill. You can relay, eat.","If you want to see it I would say go to Kawaguchiko. I don‚Äôt know how you can change your itinerary to make it easier though since to my knowledge you‚Äôll probably have to return through Tokyo for any major city.

To make it less hassle, maybe forward your luggage from Tokyo to Kanazawa using Yamato ? That way you‚Äôll be hands free going to the lake and also travelling to Kanazawa. Trust me it makes a huge difference in how complex everything feels!",
1n5kkyr,Advice on itinary for our first week in Tokyo?,"    Hello everyone !
    My wife and I are visiting Japan for the first time in November. We have 3 weeks, and we already booked most of the nights so the layout of the trip is done. 
    Our first week will be in Tokyo and we tried our best to plan each day to limit the time we spend in public transportation. 
    For context: we really look forward to visiting parks, shrines, temples, and we really enjoy discovering the cultural differences.
    
    Tue 11/11 
    11AM - Tokyo Haneda Airport
    Probably spend the day between a park/cafe, not too much walking and activities after the long flight.
    Also find an hotel for the first night which was added because our flight date was changed.
    
    Wed 12/11
    -> From here we are staying in Taito, so we want to get closer, and we decided on visiting Asakusa and doing a little loop.
    
    Senso Ji & Hikan Inari / Sumida parc & Ushijima Shrine / Tokyo Sky Tree depending on the weather / Mukojima Hyakkaen 
    
    Thu 13/11
    Close to the hotel is also Ueno park, and I believe we can spend the whole day there and around, between the national museum, the temples/shrines, and maybe Ameyoko shopping street if we feel like it.
    
    Fri 14/11
    Imperial Palace & Garden + Jinbocho (wifey loves books) + Akihabara (I'm kind of a nerd) + Kanda (Kanda Myojin & Izakaya)
    
    Sat 15/11 & Sun 16/11
    We don't really know how to organize everything yet but here is what we would like to do after some digging online :
    
    Shinjuku Gyoen park
    Meiji Jingu et Yoyogi Koen (Harajuku)
    Shibuya : Shibuya sky (Lunch or cafe), scramble crossing, Shibuya parco (nintendo) 
    Ebisu seems cute for a small walk ?
    
    Mon 17/11
    Azabudai : Templo Zojo-ji + Shiba park, Expo Teamlab Borderless + Azabudai Hills Market, Sky Lobby for diner maybe
    
    Tue 18/11 
    There must be many things left but we don't really know much about other districts we could visit. We saw Yanaka which is close to our hotel and the old Tokyo seems nice with some shrines and parks maybe ?
    
    Wed 19/11 : Early bus to Kawaguchi Lake / Mt.Fuji where the next part of the trip starts.
    
    
    Does it seem balanced to you ? We don't want to feel like we are rushing but there are many things to see, and I'm sure we missed many great spots, so if there is any district or specific spot you know about that is worth mentionning, go ahead and tell us.
    
    Also we haven't really plan any night activity but we are curious about it. Overnight market, illuminations in parks or streets, ...

Sumida park would be a solid skip for me. It's just a small area with some trees and lot of pavement. Worth for cherry blossom, and as you go in November, it's not that interesting. Same can be said about almost any park. They are park, not garden. Ueno park is ok if you go see the temple/shrine inside or if you go to one of the museum. Yoyogi park is ok on the weekend when it's warm to do some people watching.

If you like garden, then go to proper garden like Koishikawa korakuen, Hama rikyu, Shinjuku Gyoen, imperial palace garden. At least you do have some of them in the itinerary.

If you want to see illumination, search for winter illumination. They usually have in at Tokyo Dome City that start mid November and it's next to Koishikawa korakuen. But there is many other illuminations across Tokyo.","Some resto recs in the areas you‚Äôre visiting:

1n5hyye,Oigawa Railway,"Has anyone who didn‚Äôt hire a car done the Oigawa Railway? Is it possible to do in one day from either Nagoya or Tokyo? What if you stay overnight in Kanaya? Or would you need to stay somewhere along the line for it to be enjoyable and not rushed/too long a day?

If you did stay along the line, where did you stay and would you recommend it? We‚Äôre English and I‚Äôve struggled to figure out how to check availability/book on the guesthouse websites I‚Äôve looked at so far as the pages don‚Äôt translate that well.

Also is it worth just doing the southern part - before the section by bus? This seems much more viable but it also seems that the more scenic parts are on the northern part of the line. Does anyone have photos from the southern part (between Kanaya and Ieyama)?

We‚Äôre going to Japan for three weeks in October and would be fitting this in around 17th. It would mean one fewer night in Tokyo if we did stay overnight (out of 5 + 1 after a night in Hakone).

Thanks in advance!

UPDATE: Based on advice I‚Äôve received in other subreddits, I‚Äôve decided to stay somewhere along the line and have booked a guesthouse.

Edit: Might shuffle Kyoto and Osaka days around. might also do 7-day JR pass and go to Hiroshima and Kobe",https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1n5jvch/help_us_refine_our_jampacked_japan_itinerary/,"I understand you‚Äôre high energy, but you‚Äôre packing way too many things into one day. Technically, it‚Äôs possible, but you‚Äôre going to be flying from one place to the next without any time to enjoy them. 

For example, Yokohama, Enoshima, and Shibuya are all places you could easily spend a whole day (or multiple days). Expecting to hit all of them in one day, including travel time, is insane.","This feels a lot like going to an art museum, running through all the major exhibits, appreciating nothing, taking a picture, and then rushing to a science museum just outside the city, doing one thing, taking a picture, and then hurrying back into the city to then do ""crazy"" things bar hopping or whatever. Then the next morning you wanna do a day trip two-three hours away, followed up by more sightseeing in the initial city in the afternoon, followed by bar hopping. 

I get that you're young and wanna be ""wild"", but this ain't tenable. Take some time to just be where you are without overmuch worry regarding where you should be next. 

Remember that Japan is essentially the length of the East Coast of the US. Yes, it has wonderful train systems that can afford you more maximized travel than the US could, but distance is still distance. Transitions take time, and I'm not just talking about travel time. You're trying to go to NYC, squeeze a day trip to Boston within a morning, travel back to NYC to explore all of Central Park, to then finish in Brooklyn at night. And then the next day you're gonna go hit up another city, and another, and so on.

Ask yourself, what is it you really want from this trip?

I suspect that some of you feel that you might not ever get back to Japan and that you wanna maximize everything possible about visiting. And you're young, so you think that everything is doable if you just power through. Maximization does not lend itself well to memory making, in my experience. Yes, you will be able to say that you did x, y, and z to someone who asks, but when they wanna reminisce with you about how cool that specific thing was at x, will you be able to remember? 

In any case, you do you. Japan is great and you'll have fun regardless!","Where are the 'unique, offbeat, and ""crazy"" experiences'? Everything you've listed (except maybe the rafting) is standard tourist stuff.

If I'm not mistaken, you're arriving on 30 December and your day 5 is 4 January? I presume you know this is the quietest period in the Japanese calendar. Check carefully whether the places you're going are actually operating when you're planning to go.","If you really want to get wild, and I mean really wild, throw away the itinerary and just come to Japan with nothing planned except having a good time. Your itinerary is blocking you from doing exactly that",

You have a big list of locations you want to hit up, but have you considered the time things are open and how long it takes to get around in general?

For example: on Monday you want to go to Golden Gai, the National garden and go shopping in Akihabara, all on the same day. Stores in Akihabara mostly open after 12pm, Shinjuku Gyoen closes at 5:30pm, and Golden Gai is a late night thing. And like, you have to eat something along the way, right?

Wednesday is similarly overambitious, 3 museums, 2 parks, 1 art exhibit, 1 temple, feels more like a marathon to me. 

I'm not saying this is impossible, but you need to consider if you and whoever you're going with is gonna enjoy a pace like that. I can give you 2 easy cuts tho:  
1. Don't go to the Aquarium Museum, it's just plain animal abuse  
2. Assuming you're going there for the high-up views, pick 1 between Tokyo Metropolitan Government, Shibuya Sky, and Tokyo Skytree, one view of Tokyo from high up is essentially the same as another.","This looks incredibly busy. Also daytripping Hiroshima is already ambitious, but trying to squish in Hiroshima /and/ Miyajima? That just sounds plain unpleasant.¬†",The 12th doesn‚Äôt seem to take into account the 2.5 hours it takes to get from Tokyo to Kyoto.,"As another commenter said this is very ambitious. Maybe keep all these saved in google maps so you can check them out if you have time and are in the mood nearby. Plus, plenty of these places will have queues so you want to fit in some places early.

I would highlight maybe 1-3 places per day that you‚Äôre *really* most interested in, do them early, then let the rest be optional. Then you can also check they‚Äôre open that day / the times. 

I also particularly would limit specific food spots in this shortlist. You might travel there, queue for 1h, and by then you could‚Äôve eaten somewhere closer by equally tasty and also seen a temple.",

\- Give yourself day 1 in Nagoya to get over travel/jetlag, get your bearings etc. You'll be broken on day 2 otherwise and won't enjoy Kamikochi

\- On that note, don't rush yourself at Kamikochi! It's worth every minute you can spend there.

\- You have some unnecessary ""back and forth"" travel in your itinerary. By moving a few locations around you could have a smoother journey.

\- Personally, I would switch out Toyama for Kanazawa. They're right next to each other and Kanazawa is incredible.

My suggested itinerary might be something like this:

Day 1: Nagoya

Day 2: Nagoya -> Takayama

Day 3: Takayama / Shirakawa-go -> Hirayu

Day 4: Hirayu -> Kamikochi -> Matsumoto 

Day 5: Matsumoto -> Alpine Route -> Toyama/Kanazawa

Day 6: Toyama/Kanazawa

Day 7: Toyama/Kanazawa -> Nagoya

Day 8: Nagoya -> Home

\---

Some other notes:

\- If you want a slightly more relaxed day 3, try the Hida Folk Village instead of Shirakawa-go. It's only a few minutes from the centre of Takayama and is still wonderful.

\- There's very good luggage storage at Kamikochi

\- If you're going to really splurge for one night of accommodation, try to book a really nice ryokan with a kaiseki dinner in Hirayu Onsen. They can be pricey, but oh my god is it worth it for kaiseki hida beef.",,,,
1n52q39,"Kansai Region Itinerary, 8 Days in January. First time solo traveller. Please review? :)","I‚Äôm visiting the Kansai region only in January 2026, after visiting Tokyo earlier this year. I‚Äôll be staying in Osaka. It‚Äôs my first solo trip and I‚Äôm VERY nervous but excited! I‚Äôm staying near Osaka castle as my base. I would love some advice on my itinerary and help switching things around or even getting some suggestions for things I haven‚Äôt thought of yet. I have no places down for food as I like to just pop into places on the fly.

For reference I‚Äôm 28f, I‚Äôm heavily into gaming and nerdy stuff, I love love Pok√©mon, studio ghibli and anime in general. I‚Äôm also an artist so into all things arty.

‚ú®Day 0

(because I‚Äôm flying in late I‚Äôm not really counting this day) Arrive at my hotel in Osaka about 10pm and staying in for the night.

‚ú®Day 1, first full day in Osaka

Up early 7:30, out the door for 8:30 -Visit Osaka Castle as it‚Äôs nearby. -Explore Dotonburi -Stroll to Denden town -Namba Yasaka Jinja Shinto Shrine BEFORE 5PM -Shinsekai and back to Dotonbori for night lights and food.

‚ú®Day 2, Nara day trip

Wake up 7, leave by 8, get there around 9:30/10 -Todai-ji -Deer park -Kofokuji (I need some suggestions on more spots to visit here!)

‚ú®Day 3 - Kyoto overnight trip.

Wake up at 6, leave by 7, get there around 8:30-9 -Fushimi inari first thing -Kiyumizu dera -Walk to gion -Visit Heian Jingu shrine

‚ú®Day 4 - waking up in kyoto

Wake up early, 7am, leave at 8pm -check out Kinkakuji, philosophers path (I know I probably could do with switching around sites in Kyoto to be better logistically, suggestions greatly appreciated) -Wander around Kyoto freely, visit Pok√©mon center Kyoto, do some shopping. -Head back to central Osaka in the evening, -Abeno Harukas observation deck, -Dotonburi for evening snack.

‚ú®Day 5 -Hiroshima day trip.

-Visit the Atomic Bomb Dome, -Hiroshima Peace Memorial -Flame of Peace -Hiroshima castle (Suggestions on what else to do welcome! Any cool things off the beaten path in Hiroshima?)

‚ú®Day 6 - Universal Studios

Not sure if I will put in a whole day here. I plan on getting the fast pass and I feel I may get bored as a solo traveller, so I may have time in the evening for something else? Suggestions to fit something else later in the day in the Osaka area would be cool.

‚ú®Day 7 - Himeji day trip, (with a possible stop in Kobe, is this too much to fit in?)

-Visit Himeji Castle, -Stroll in Kokoen -Engyoji Temple using cable car -Treat myself to some wagyu beef on this day either while I‚Äôm in Himeji or back in Osaka (restaurant recommendations? it‚Äôs my last night so maybe I could go all out!)

‚ú®Day 8 - Flying home :‚Äô(

Free roam Osaka until the evening time then head home! Do some shopping, check out some retro game shops, stop in my favourite places in Osaka one more time. Flight at 10:30pm, so leave hotel at 6pm.

Bonus: Where would be the safest to rent a bicycle? I love the idea of leisurely cycling somewhere pretty while I‚Äôm in Japan, but traffic somewhere I‚Äôm not familiar with makes me nervous so any cycling only paths in any of the places I visit would be really nice! If I can fit it in!

I‚Äôm really looking forward to hearing your advice and suggestions üíï",https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1n52q39/kansai_region_itinerary_8_days_in_january_first/,"For Day 2 suggestions, the obvious answer would be Kasuga Shrine as it's right there. This is the shrine that all the deer are associated with. If you like history and art, the National Museum is definitely worth checking out.

The area to the south of K≈çfukuji is a charming shopping district called Naramachi. Would be a perfect place to wander around and pop in for lunch at a random independently owned joint.

If you're looking to spend more time in Nara, there are plenty more temples in the city such as Yakushiji and T≈çsh≈çdaiji, but to be honest unless you're really into history they're all going to start to feel the same.

For a more unique and scenic experience I love Hasedera, located on the mountainside in a small town (I don't think there's even a conbini there). It's a bit out of the way so double check your train timetables.","For cycling, check out the Shiminami Kaido. You can just do a day trip to a few islands. They have rentals in Onomichi. I‚Äôm going in September to do it.","I mean this as gently as possible, but why would you make your base near the Castle? You are potentially losing a ton of time each day trying to get to a train line that will take you where you want to go. 

There are some logistical snarls in your itinerary as is, but it looks like you have a good trip planned! When I‚Äôm not on mobile I can give better recs.",,
1n4wbuo,Feedback on my Itinerary (help with Kyoto),"My brother and I are heading to Japan in October. He is only able to take 2 weeks off but I will stay for another 2 weeks. So the general plan is to try to hit the ‚Äúhot spots‚Äù along the golden route while he is there and go a *little* slower when he leaves with just 1-2 major spots/day and day trips. I put more planning into the first two weeks so far since I might change my weeks depending on what we do together.

Accommodations have already been booked so we will be staying at Asakusa station the first week, at Kyoto station the second week. The ryokans in Hakone and Miyajima and the express pass tickets for USJ have been booked so those days are locked - other days can be swapped/adjusted.

Some days might look busy but we don‚Äôt like to sit around much. But if you do see a day that seems impossible because of travel/distance let me know. I'm still struggling with Kyoto since we don't have much time there and know it's impossible to cram everything in 1.5 days (first half of the trip) without rushing. We'd want to see the ""must sees"" during the 2nd week and I can visit spots we missed on the return.

Thanks for any feedback and suggestions!

So, I'm trying to take a different, more bird's eye approach to planning this Tokyo/Kyoto trip. I want to leave room for exploration.

We are Disney nerds and are trying to visit every Disney park in the world, so I definitely allotted a little time in the agenda for that. I'm also a huge Starbucks person and have made it a goal to visit every Roastery in the world, so that's on the itinerary, too.

Other than that, I'd love to hear what people think of this itinerary. I don't expect to see and do everything in each of these cities in such a short amount of time, but is there anything else we MUST do? Is there any way I can organize the schedule any better?

Thank you in advance!

Because you haven‚Äôt factored returning from Kyoto to Tokyo into your schedule that you‚Äôve posted. 

My advice would be to skip Arashiyama - way too crowded and not worth the effort. Kodai-ji is 1000 times better. When we went there were only 5 other people there. It was brilliant. 

As others have said - don‚Äôt lock Fuji in. The weather is very unpredictable so you want a little flexibility on that. 

And finally - the coffee. Expand your horizons beyond Starbucks. Japanese coffee houses are something very special. There are even craft coffee bars in Tokyo. Even something as basic as Mr Coffee is leagues better than Starbucks. Don‚Äôt limit yourself to Starbucks. Trust me. Your tastebuds will thank you later.","Do not lock the Mt. Fuji day in your itinerary. Visibility is still unpredictable in autumn, so you should watch [the forecast](https://fuji-san.info/en/index.html) and pick a good weather day to go closer to the time.

1n4eqpr,Please Provide Feedback for this First-Timer's Japan Itinerary!,"Hi! Please bear with me as I navigate Reddit‚Äîthis is my first post :)

For some background: I booked our trip for the last week of December, and we‚Äôll be visiting Tokyo, Kyoto, and Osaka. Since we‚Äôre arriving and departing from NRT (thanks, Zipair), we‚Äôll be spending quite a bit of time on the shinkansen, so I‚Äôve had to plan the itinerary around that.

I know the schedule looks ambitious, but I‚Äôm Gen Z with the attention span of a toddler, so I think we‚Äôll be quick on our feet and able to cover a lot! A little side note: we‚Äôre not spending much time in Tokyo, so I focused more on the western side‚Äîthink Shibuya, Shinjuku, and Ginza. I‚Äôd love to come back one day to explore Asakusa, Ikebukuro, and other spots, but that will have to wait for another trip.

If you have suggestions, I‚Äôd appreciate it if you could keep them centered around the areas I‚Äôve already planned. And while I know my itinerary looks pretty touristy (I am a tourist, after all), I‚Äôd also love to hear about any ‚Äúoff the beaten path‚Äù recommendations you think are worth checking out!

  
Here it is! Thanks to TikTok and YouTube for helping me curate this:

Day 1 (Tokyo): Gotokuji Temple & explore the Harajuku, Omotesando, and Shibuya areas

Day 2 (Tokyo): Tsukiji Market, explore the Ginza area, teamLab Borderless, Azabudai Christmas Market, explore Shinjuku at night

Day 3: Shinkansen from Tokyo to Kyoto, Fushimi Inari Shrine, Aeon Mall

Day 4 (Kyoto): Nishiki Market, tea ceremony, Ninenzaka, Sannenzaka, Kiyomizu-dera Temple

Day 5 (Kyoto): Otagi Nenbutsuji Temple, Adashino Nenbutsuji Temple, explore the Arashiyama area, cross Togetsukyo Bridge, Katsura River sightseeing boat, Yusai-tei Gallery, night walk along Pontocho, Hanamikoji, and Yasaka Shrine

Day 6: Matcha crawl in Uji, Byodo-in Temple, commute to Osaka, Umeda Sky Building

Day 7 (Osaka): Katsuoji Temple, Minoh Park/Falls, Shinsekai

Day 8 (Osaka): Nakazakicho Cafe Street & retro shopping, Kuromon Market, Dotonbori, Shinsaibashi

I think you can probably tell that I‚Äôm the most excited for Kyoto and had the hardest time planning Osaka. I feel like we could fit something into Day 7 since we‚Äôll be in northern Osaka in the morning and then heading to Shinsekai at night, so we don‚Äôt really have afternoon plans. We‚Äôll probably be all templed out by then, so I‚Äôd love any suggestions for things to do in between!",https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1n4eqpr/please_provide_feedback_for_this_firsttimers/,"8 days 3 cities is like navigating new York, chicago and Miami in 8 days, except you don't read or speak the language.
You do you.","Please don't rely on TikTok and YouTube. People who post there systematically distort reality (because reality is not exciting enough).

I will also specifically recommend against Gotokuji, a mundane place particularly prone to distortion by photography and video. What you've seen on TikTok and YouTube is three small shelves of cat figurines left by visitors behind a single outbuilding. The vast majority of the grounds are closed off to casual visitors (because of overtourism and (judging by the last time I stopped by) tourists who don't seem to understand what fences and multilingual 'Keep Out' signs mean.

North of the tourist districts you'll be visiting on your day 2 is Imado Shrine, which is a real cat place. Go there on your next visit.","Currently in Japan, moving much slower, travel every three days and we don‚Äôt do half as much. Maybe one or two activities, or we do a Guruwalk guided tour which covers a lot and we get info and not just passing by to look and take pics","I was in Japan in the last week of December last year and early January as well. Just bear in mind, the tourists are mind staggering - crowds everywhere and lines to queue up. More than usual even given the holiday season. 

Whilst I appreciate that you are quick on your feet, bear in mind with the crowds - you literally may have to double your time almost everywhere.

Noting that because of Christmas lights - the locals be out too for date nights - it‚Äôs busy. And like forget about Harajuku - my god - you literally be like packed sardines - I look at Takeshita Dori - and just skip - but bear in mind, it‚Äôs not my first visit to Japan but it you really want the atmosphere by all means no one should stop you but I felt that it‚Äôs nothing really amazing - much like overhype nowadays by influencers.",
1n43iey,"First solo trip to Japan, advice?","I am planning to travel near or around Tokyo this year during the autumn season during the 2nd last week of November. I have some questions along the way. I am fairly new in airport procedures and travelling to other countries.

The main sites I want to visit are Mount Mitake, Lake Kawaguchi to see the Mount Fuji view and Tokyo Skytree. I am not really into seeing the city but I just wanted to have Tokyo Skytree checked off my bucketlist. The day trip to Ome is so that I can visit Mount Mitake afterwards.

I am confused by the different URLs about the Japan trains so if you can drop me the URLS to the train schedule or suggest a transport planner app, that would be great. It will save me the hassle of finding the right links or calling up the place. I am not sure if JR line means that I can just wait for the train to arrive in a few minutes or do we have to follow a strict timing?

You can‚Äôt predict ahead of time how long you‚Äôll spend at places and you‚Äôll stumble across interesting things, get lost, miss trains and have other minor mishaps.

As public transport coverage in most Japanese cities is excellent, you also don‚Äôt need to plan this in advance. Just use Google maps to help you navigate around over each day.

There are also a vast range of restaurants and cafes in Japan, so you don‚Äôt need to plan meals in advance.","not a good idea to plan every minute, things will go wrong. just use maps to get around each day and find food as u go.",I use this website for train times. https://roote.ekispert.net/en,I would take the Narita Express from Narita to Shinjuku on your arrival instead of the Skyliner.

1n3u86y,13 day Travel Korea and Japan advice appreciated,"Hi, Could I get some advice on filling out my itinerary there's just so much to do, and so little days I am overwhelmed.

I'm 23 male, going with my 18 year old sister.

Both never travelled before, so it's our first time.

My sister seems to want to do more shopping, and take pictures, while I want to try a bit of everything.

Our budget is mid-range, and willing to spend around 5-7k aud in total including flight tickets (we will take budget flight around $800 round trip).

We are planning to going around late November, early December.

I don't think I'll be back in Japan any time soon, since I want to visit other countries too so trying to get as much of an experience as possible within a reasonable budget, and energy budget (I get tired easily).

Thoughts on my itinerary, any recommendations? (BTW we don't speak any Japanese - although we can learn if required for a better experience in the next few months)

**Day 1**: Depart early morning to Daegu, Korea (land in evening). Minimal stop at Seoul.

**Day 2**: Full day in Daegu and visit family.

**Day 3**: Depart early morning to Tokyo. Land in afternoon. Rest. Evening stroll.

* Shibuya Crossing
* Shibuya Sky

**Day 4** \- Ginza

* 12 story Uniqlo
* Itoya Stationary Store
* Muji Ginza
* Try sushi in Ginza¬†
* Visit luxury malls

**Day 5:** Akihabara

* Maid cafe
* Themed dining
* Anime stores/Gaming stores

**Day 6:** Disney Sea (Was wondering between Disney Land and Disney Sea) have not been to any disney land either, and was wondering which would be better.

**Day 7:** Open for discussion

**Day 8:** Last day to just chill, and walk around Tokyo and just explore randomly.

**Day 9**: Depart for Kyoto in the morning. Arrive in the afternoon, and drop off luggage at accommodation.

Power nap.

Explore the city of Kyoto.

* Nishiki Market
* Downtown Kyoto
* Gion & Yasaka Shrine
* Pontocho Alley

**Day 10**: Explore the nature and history of Kyoto.

* Bamboo Forest
* Kiyomizu-dera (Buddhist Temple)
* Fushimi Inari Shrine
* Higashiyama Area (Lunch)

**Day 11**: Osaka temple.

**Day 12:** Osaka - open for discussion

**Day 13**: Osaka + leave for home.",https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1n3u86y/13_day_travel_korea_and_japan_advice_appreciated/,"For the cities you‚Äôre going to, you can definitely get away with speaking English. If you‚Äôre able to know a couple of basic words/phrases that would help though. (I would try to remember the phrase to ask if someone speaks English. For the most part, people in these cities will speak both Japanese and English as a second language and are very friendly if you ask nicely for some assistance). 

I recommend planning on spending mostly cash. While larger places will have card available, cash is king and more commonly used. It can also help so you‚Äôre not paying a fee for the conversion rate on every charge. 

Bring your passport when shopping. You can get tax-free in a lot of places so long as you have your passport. This may be changing with japans new tourist regulations coming into play. 

I always end up bringing home a lot of stuff but keep in mind that a lot of items can be available in your home country. Be mindful of your budget/suitcase space for items you can get otherwise. 

Disney sea is great! I always recommend going to Disney sea over land as it‚Äôs a more unique park. They still have fun rides and cool novelty items such as the different flavour popcorn. Definitely get the app and be prepared for lines. Try to coordinate priority passes for any ride you absolutely want to do. Pretty much everyone there is dressed up for Disney so it can be fun to dress up/do makeup/etc. basically you won‚Äôt feel like you overdid it if you want to dress up like your favourite character. 

If your sister is wanting some cool photos, she may enjoy going to team lab boarderless in Tokyo. If you are pressed on time, I would prioritize other things but it can be a cool place to take some pictures. 

Two meals that I consider musts in Japan is yakiniku and okonomiyaki. Yakiniku is a do it yourself style Japanese BBQ, where the grill is on the table. Okonomiyaki is a kind of ‚Äúdinner pancake‚Äù with either cabbage or noodles, batter, and meat and sometimes an egg. It is typically made in front of you so can be cool to see made in an Okonomiyaki-ya (okonomiyaki restaurant). I‚Äôd recommend looking up restaurants in Japanese so you get the restaurants that are popular with locals. 

There are also a lot of bakeries that are pretty easy to find for an easy breakfast/snack. 7-eleven and Lawson‚Äôs are also very prevalent and good for a cheap/quick meal. Grocery stores will also have sections with ready made items/meals to buy. 

Vending machines will be everywhere. I don‚Äôt bring a water bottle to Japan when I go as I know that it‚Äôs often easier to just get a bottle of water when I‚Äôm thirsty and recycle it once empty. 

Finally, Japan is very clean and garbage/recycle disposal is taken very seriously. I keep a small zip lock bag for any garbage that I might acquire throughout a day out so I don‚Äôt dirty my bag if I have to hold onto something for a while before finding some bins. 

I hope you have fun planning/on your trip, hope this advice helps!","Day 10:
Arashiyama Bamboo Forest, Kiyomizu-dera and Fushimi Inari in one day is going to be hectic. They're geographically dispersed and Kyoto transit isn't as efficient as in Tokyo.¬†


You could go to Fushimi Inari in the morning on the way to Osaka on day 11. I'm not sure how busy it is that time of year but it was packed when I was there in April so it make sense to go early. I travel with just a backpack which is easy so this may not work if you're the type to have a lot of luggage.¬†",,,

Additionally, if you map it, it‚Äôs quite far from your other locations so you would need to bake in time to fly there and back. It might be easier to stick to southern cities and do a city closer to your other locations. Perhaps stay at a ryokan in Hakone and see that side of Japan?
When you‚Äôre in Tokyo it doesn‚Äôt seem like you‚Äôre doing much of the standard things people would do. See temples, Tokyo Tower or Skytree, go through all the districts (Asakusa, Ginza, Shibuya). If that isn‚Äôt already baked into your plan you should add some of those things.¬†

You're leaving your luggage in Tokyo? Why not take it with you on the Shinkansen? It's extremely expensive to store luggage, even 4 days could be hundreds of dollars depending on size.

Going to the Cup Noodle Museum from where you're staying and then going to Dotonbori/Den Den Town is going to take longer than you think. Cup Noodle Museum is all the way at the northern edge of Osaka, so let's say you get that 9:30 when they open (1 hour traveling), spend an hour there, then travel from there to Dotonbori early afternoon (1 hour traveling), from there you would only have the afternoon/evening for Dotonbori and Den Den town. Be aware of energy levels and travelling time because zooming across the city can be exhausting. 

Kyoto is more busy and crowded than you can imagine. If you plan on going to the bamboo forest, be the first ones there or you will be shoulder to shoulder. Also Kyoto doesn't have subways its just buses and they can get crowded and inconvenient. 

Not recommended to hit both Shibuya and Shinjuku on the same day as a travel day. You're going to be tired and both areas demand a lot of walking.

Again, can't hit Akihabara, Asakusa and Skytree on the same day especially saturday when the entire city is also out shopping. Skytree and Asakusa are realistic on the same day because it's so close. 

You can't hit Kamakura, Yokohama, and Costco at the same day. They are all in totally different regions and take a long time to travel between all of them. It's like saying I'm going to visit Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Sacremento on the same day.",,,,

We are mainly interested in food, art, nature, shopping and nightlife. Trying to keep this as a ""broad strokes"" itinerary organized around general areas/neighborhoods and anything that has to be booked in advance, as we enjoy just wandering on foot. I have a Google Map with tons of restaurants and bars bookmarked, but will plan to mostly play it by ear.

Any suggestions for ""must-do's"" we're missing? Not really interested in Teamlabs. I know 2 nights in Kyoto is quite squeezed, but not able to change that at this point due to booking points hotels. Any advice greatly appreciated :)

\* **Monday 10/6** \- Arrive at Haneda around 3:30pm. Taxi to hotel in Shibuya to avoid train rush hour. Figure we'll settle in, wander a bit, get konbini snacks for the room and grab dinner, depending on our level of exhaustion.

\* **Tuesday 10/7** \- Explore Shibuya. Meiji Jingu, shopping in Harajuku/Cat Street, La Foret. Sunset at Shibuya Sky followed by drinks and dinner in the area.

\* **Wednesday 10/8** \- Nezu Museum. Lunch or dinner at Yokozuna Tonkatsu Dosukoi Tanaka for the sumo show (haven't booked yet).

\* **Thursday 10/9** \- Tokyo Metropolitan Teien Art Museum. Explore shopping and cafes and visit Kyu Asakura in Daikanyama; check out vintage stores in Shimokitazawa.

\* **Friday 10/10** \- Yayoi Kusama museum (hoping to grab tickets when they become available 9/1). Dark Side of Tokyo night walking tour in Kabukicho, followed by Golden Gai.

\* **Saturday 10/11** \- Daytime open. Clubbing in Shibuya and/or live music in Shimokitazawa.

\* **Sunday 10/12** \- Hamarikyu Gardens. Shopping and lunch in Ginza; drinks at Ginza Lion 7. Explore Akihabara (Yodobashi, Pop Life Department M's, Chabara).

\* **Monday 10/13** \- Morning train to Hakone. Hakone Loop. Soak in private onsen @ hotel.

\* **Tuesday 10/14** \- Morning shinkansen to Kyoto. Heian Jingu Shrine; Kyoto Gyoen National Garden. Night walking tour of Gion.

\* **Wednesday 10/15** \- Full day in Kyoto, currently undecided on what to do. Would like to avoid the most mobbed places as I don't enjoy packed-in crowds. Current ideas include Eikando, Arashiyama Monkey Park, Nijo Castle.

It has an incredible view of the entire city. Additionally, just across the street from the building there is a nice park area with restaurants and green spaces that has a really nice vibe, especially in the evening. 

For Hiroshima, I‚Äôd recommend giving one day for Hiroshima and one day for Miyajima. IMO, Hiroshima has more to offer then the bomb dome, for example: Shukkeien Garden, Hiroshima castle, Koganeyama Park (really nice view of Hiroshima), etc. 

Also a general tip, consider travel times between cities and give yourself time to just explore the cities","The Shirohige joints (there are two) are on the other side of Tokyo from the places you're planning to go on 27 November and within walking distance of the places you're planning to go on 30 November.

23 November is a holiday that will be celebrated on 25 November. Not only will that mean your stay in Hakone will be on a three day weekend, but it will be at an ultra-jammed time. It also means that Shinjuku Gyouen will be closed on 26 November, the day you're planning to go.

My advice would be to (a) decide what you want to do, (b) find out where and when you can do those things, and (c) choose one thing for the morning and early afternoon and one other nearby thing for the late afternoon and evening, then check opening hours and the like. Asking a large language model like ChatGPT to produce an itenerary is not quite so dumb as asking your friend who's only every read some comic books set in Japan to plan for you, but it's pretty close.",Your itinerary looks good!

This is kind of wild.  You‚Äôre either in a new city or day tripping to another city in 16 times in 17 dayd and have 2+ hour transportation on about 14 of them.  Some are 4-5 hrs round trip.

Stay in Shibuya or Shinjuku for ‚Äúgreat transit‚Äù lol, okay ChatGPT.  What wording is that?  What‚Äôs casual ramen?  

Day 5 needs a map, especially if Ghibli is involved.  Shinjuku.  Akihabara probably on day 4 since that‚Äôs over by Ueno.  

Day 6, wow.

Day 7 is suffering from so many cities in a very short period.  This is ideally two days because of how far apart Arashiyama is from Nara.  You have to do it this way since you don‚Äôt have any other days.

Day 9, you don‚Äôt need Shin-Osaka for access to USJ or KIX.  Namba or Umeda actually has much more around than shin-Osaka and you can get to both places.",This trip seems to have a lot of 'sit still on the train for five hours' days. It looks not only exhausting but also nearly devoid of anything that might interest children (except for maybe days 6 and 15).,"Day 6 looks soooo packed. In my opinion, I'd probably skip Hakone if you aren't planning to stay for a few days. It's really pretty but I feel it's more of a place to relax. Also, I'd check in with your children to see if they're actually interested in the museum/shrine/garden/castle type things. My siblings definitely did not enjoy Kyoto as much as I did. They basically ditched me after the first few shrines I visited. I think the thing they found most enjoyable for Kyoto was Uji and the Arashiyama lunch on a Yakatabune. If your kids like being on a boat in the water, I would recommend that as you have enough people to book your own boat. 

My suggestion would be for you to have an idea of places you want to go and also pre-book any reservations for  attractions/meals that you don't want to miss AT ALL. Then just letting the day lead you. For example, my itinerary would probably be more like:   
Day 1- Explore Shinjuku area  
Day 2 - Asakusa temple + surroundings   
Then list down the possible places you might want to see as you probably aren't going to see all of them. I know with my sibs and I (were in our 20-30s), we definitely took a lot more breaks than we thought we would have needed, especially after the first few days. We usually walk/hike a lot in our daily lives, but Japan takes it to the next level. There are most likely going to be times where you just want to chill for an hour or two at the hotel to rest up. 

Don't feel too bad if you don't see everything on your itinerary as you can always visit Japan again. Also, depending on where you are from, the climate might also have an impact on your travels. I know for certain my sis and I were way too overdressed in November when we visited last year and definitely had days where it was too hot for our comfort. We basically had to plan around that as well.","Day 6 is way too hectic imo. Recommend cutting out Hakone or spending at least 1 night there (i love hakone so i always opt to stay there 1-2 nights haha).  Hakone is a place to take a break and relax!

The Hakone loop (ropeway + owakudani + pirate ship) which imo is one of the main things to do in Hakone is going to take MUCH longer than 1.5hrs. Probably more like 4hrs+ when you factor in waiting in lines, and also to actually enjoy and take everything in.",

The times I‚Äôve approximated based on checking the trip durations by train. I know early morning will be bad since weekdays people go to work.

Spending 30 minutes somewhere just because you pack your schedule is silly, choose a couple of things and enjoy them, you can always go back.

In saying that, if you can make it work, go for it.","I mean look, if you want to go to Kamakura on four hours of sleep nobody can stop you. But of course all of this is insane.

1n1t5zf,Second trip to Japan: 3 week itinerary (Spring/Sakura 2026),"Earlier this year my girlfriend and I visited Japan for the first time, and recently wrote [this trip report](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1msreeg/3week_japan_travel_itineraryreport/) about it. It was so amazing that we decided to go again next year. This time we want to experience the Sakura season, so we‚Äôve booked March 28 ‚Äì April 17 (yes, I know we definitely won‚Äôt have the country to ourselves).  
We only have the round trip flights to Tokyo booked for now, the rest is still flexible.

The trip will include a mix of places we haven‚Äôt been yet, and some we‚Äôve already visited but where we feel there‚Äôs still plenty left to do (you could be in Tokyo for a year and never get bored, right?).

We do want to take it a bit slower this time, especially in Tokyo and Kyoto where we‚Äôve already been. We‚Äôve got some activity options for those cities, but it‚Äôll be less about ticking off as many must-sees as possible since we‚Äôve already covered a lot of the ‚Äúusual suspects.‚Äù

Here‚Äôs the plan so far, along with some concrete questions. I‚Äôd also love to hear if there are must-dos I‚Äôm forgetting (and didn‚Äôt already do on my first trip), or if there are things I listed that aren‚Äôt really worth it. We enjoy culture, nature, hiking, history, good food and drinks (bar hopping), nights out, sports, outdoor activities, but also some relaxation here and there.

**Saturday March 28 ‚Äì Tuesday March 31: Tokyo**

* Yoyogi Park (Sunday): last time we weren‚Äôt there on a weekend, curious about the dancing Elvises.
* TeamLab. Question: I don‚Äôt know if Borderless or Planets is better. Anyone who‚Äôs been to both and can share a comparison?
* Nakamise Dori (the shopping street was already closed last time we visited Senso-ji).
* Day trip to Nikko. Or should I save that for a future autumn trip with the fall colors?

Otherwise we‚Äôll take it easy, stroll around, and see what we feel like. Check out neighborhoods outside the city center, like Nakameguro, Akabane, and Kichijoji (maybe visit the Ghibli museum). Wandering without a set plan. Any tips for quieter, charming neighborhoods?

Morning flight Tokyo ‚Üí Fukuoka¬†

Pick up rental car in Fukuoka. Start of \~1 week Kyushu road trip¬†

Drive Fukuoka ‚Üí Nagasaki

Evening in Nagasaki: Mount Inasayama night view¬†

**Wednesday April 1: Nagasaki**

* Peace Park (Atomic Bomb Museum)
* Dejima
* Shinchi Chinatown¬†

**Thursday April 2**

Drive Nagasaki ‚Üí Takachiho Gorge

Explore Takachiho Gorge (rowing boat, etc.)¬†

Drive Takachiho Gorge ‚Üí Kurokawa¬†

Late afternoon + evening in Kurokawa, enjoy onsen¬†

**Friday April 3**

Morning: more onsen in Kurokawa

Drive Kurokawa Onsen ‚Üí Beppu

Afternoon + evening in Beppu, more onsen

**Questions:**

* Is Beppu worth it? Or would Yufuin be better?
* I haven‚Äôt included Mt. Aso in this plan. Should I try to fit it in somehow? For example, instead of Beppu/Yufuin stay another night in Kurokawa and make a day trip to Mt. Aso? Or add an extra day to the Kyushu road trip and cut that day from somewhere else in the itinerary?

**Saturday April 4**

Morning: more onsen in Beppu, maybe the Hells of Beppu

Drive Beppu ‚Üí Fukuoka. Return rental car

Afternoon + evening in Fukuoka:

* Food stall (yatai) safari
* Saturday night in Tenjin

**Sunday April 5: Fukuoka**

* Ohori Park
* A museum in Fukuoka
* Some shopping at Canal City

**Monday April 6**

Train Fukuoka ‚Üí Miyajima

Day on Miyajima:

* Itsukushima Shrine/Torii
* Daisho-in Temple
* Hike Mount Misen
* Tsutsumigaura Beach

Overnight on Miyajima

**Tuesday April 7**

Morning train Miyajima ‚Üí Himeji

Himeji Castle + Kokoen Garden

Train Himeji ‚Üí Kobe

Afternoon + evening in Kobe: Kobe beef dinner

**Wednesday April 8**

Morning in Kobe

Train Kobe ‚Üí Kyoto

*Note:* We‚Äôre considering skipping the Kobe overnight and instead going straight to Kyoto, then doing Kobe as a day trip from there. That means a bit more train travel, but also avoids another single-night stop, which might make the trip more relaxed.

**April 8 ‚Äì April 11: Kyoto**

* Kinkaku-ji
* Ginkaku-ji
* Kiyomizu-dera
* Sakura party at Hirano Shrine (April 10)

**Questions:**

* Is Nara (park) worth it? The bowing deer seem a bit touristy to me, but people seem enthusiastic about Nara.
* Is it worth going to Amanohashidate? It looks beautiful and is one of Japan‚Äôs ‚ÄúThree Scenic Views,‚Äù but it‚Äôs quite a long day trip by train from Kyoto.

**Saturday April 11**

Train Kyoto ‚Üí Nagoya

Day + overnight in Nagoya

**Question:** Is Nagoya worth a one-night stop, or should we skip it and use the time elsewhere?

**Sunday April 12**

Train Nagoya ‚Üí Hakone

Mt. Fuji views + onsen

Overnight in Hakone

**Question:** We really want to see Mt. Fuji, last time we didn‚Äôt because of clouds. Is it better to stay overnight in Hakone on the way to Tokyo, or as a day trip from Tokyo when the weather is clear? Staying overnight on our way to Tokyo saves travel time compared to a round trip from Tokyo, and gives us more rest + a chance to see Fuji in the early morning. But less flexibility with the weather.

Or is there a better spot than Hakone for Fuji views (on our route or easily accessible), either as an overnight on our way to Tokyo or a day trip from Tokyo? Lake Kawaguchi? Lake Yamanaka?

**Monday April 13 ‚Äì Friday April 17: Tokyo**

April 13: Train Hakone ‚Üí Tokyo

Do whatever we didn‚Äôt get to in the first Tokyo days. Keep it relaxed, not too much planning.

April 17: flight home

This is our rough plan. We‚Äôd also love to spend one or two days off the beaten path in the countryside (inaka?), but not sure how or where. Does anyone know good options for that, or should I save it for a future Japan trip?

Thanks for reading and for any input, I really appreciate it!",https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1n1t5zf/second_trip_to_japan_3_week_itinerary/,"I have a house in beppu, i dont like yufuin that much. So i recommend beppu, there are some nice hidden onsen like a green house onsen and onsen in the mountain! Food is good with a cozy center with a lot of izakaya.","Amanohashidate is worth it IMO. I went last year in May as a day trip from Kyoto. Left the station on the limited express train around 8 a.m. and got there around 10 a.m. Before you leave the station at Amanohashidate to go explore, go buy your return ticket at the clerk's window. Those return seats for leaving on the limited express train after 5 p.m. fill up fast. I got the last 5 p.m return ticket to Kyoto when I arrived back at the station. You could probably buy the return ticket before you even leave Kyoto station, but I didn't do that because I didn't know how much time I wanted to spend there.

It was really relaxing just riding a bike through the sandbar and enjoying the weather. I stopped a lot when I was riding the bike, but I had to hurry since I didn't rent for long. I should've rented for longer. You could just walk too, but riding a bike is always more fun IMO. Ride the ferry back to where you started. You can see the seagulls fly around you on the top deck. I've been to Japan 3 times, and Amanohashidate was one of my most memorable experiences. I did make sure to go on a day that was sunny, but you'd have to be super flexible with your days to do that. Bought my ticket 1-2 days before I went.

Also, the limited express train isn't the only way to get there, but it was just my preferred choice of transportation.

EDIT: I think you should skip Nagoya and use it for a day trip to Amanohashidate. I'd also skip your other one night stops. One night stops make for a more tiring trip.

EDIT 2: Wouldn't it be better to start in Fukuoka and save all Tokyo days for the very end? You condense your hotel accommodations this way. Less packing and checking in.",,,
1n1xxun,"5/6 Day Tokyo Trip with Kids, will this itinerary work?","Two adults traveling with two kids (ages 7 and 10). Beginning of October. We are working on the timing of transportation. Want to make sure we aren't trying to do too much or too little with our time in Japan. 

Day 0 (Tues): Arrive 2pm, make our way to AirBnb in Nakano City (trying to decide between public transportation and hiring a car to take us after a long day of travel). Explore the area and grab food.

Day 1 (Wednesday): Rest, explore in the AM (may stick near AirBnb or head across city), food, Tokyo SkyTree, 4:30p Maikoya Kimono Tea Ceremony (kid friendly version)

Day 2 (Thursday): DisneySea day

Day 3 (Friday): Day Trip to Hakone. We plan on buying the Hakone Free Pass. Spend 2-3 hours at the Open Air Museum. Ride the Ropeway, starting at the Sounzan End. Ride the Pirate Ship across the Lake. Would love recommendations for kid friendly dining in the area.   
  
Day 4 (Saturday): AM Making of Harry Potter (likely around 4 hours with some flex time). PM Sunshine City Mall to go to the Pokemon Center, Pokemon Sweets Cafe and Ghibli store. 

Day 5 (Sunday): Day trip to Kamakura/Enoshima. Plan on going to the Hasedera and the Caves in Enoshima. Want to give ourselves time at each place. May stop at the Enoshima Aquarium or the Lighthouse on the island.

Would love input on sights we shouldn't miss and on kid friendly food (I imagine it's going to be lots of Katsu and plain ramen noodles).",https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1n1xxun/56_day_tokyo_trip_with_kids_will_this_itinerary/,">Day 3 (Friday): Day Trip to Hakone.

I personally think this will be too rushed to get the train there in the morning, spend 2-3 hours at the Open Air Museum, and do the loop before heading home. We covered the loop and the open air museum across 2 days as 2 grown adults. Doing this with 2 young kids in tow that will probably move slower and naturally need more breaks feels like it's not the best use of your limited time - IMO. I feel like Hakone either needs 1 night over (with 2 days). People do do it as a day trip, I just personally would feel rushed fitting it into 1 day, travel in and out, based on my experience of visiting Hakone.",,,,
1n1fcnm,First Solo Trip to Japan ‚Äì October 2025 (13 nights),"Hi all, I hope all is well

I went to Japan once before in 2023 with my girlfriend, but this time I‚Äôm going solo. I‚Äôm recovering from burnout and trying to figure myself out a little, learning to enjoy being alone, making my own choices, and hopefully meeting some people along the way.

I‚Äôm not really aiming for strict sightseeing this time since I already did most of that before. I just want to chill, eat amazing food, do some shopping, and enjoy the nightlife. During the day I like wandering around, checking out small shops and markets,fooooood, and relaxing in parks or caf√©s. At night, I love exploring the city, bar hopping, street food, and maybe even a little bar crawl.

**Days 1‚Äì2: Tokyo (Shinjuku)**

* Day 1 (Oct 5): Arriving at Haneda around noon, then heading to my hotel in Shinjuku. Planning to explore Shimokitazawa for some shopping, grab a relaxed lunch, and wander around Omoide Yokocho in the evening.
* Day 2 (Oct 6): Taking it easy in the morning, maybe Shinjuku Gyoen Garden or a good breakfast spot nearby. In the afternoon, I‚Äôve got TeamLab Planets at 17:30 and might grab dinner in Toyosu afterwards if thats even a thing. Back to Shinjuku later, maybe a couple of late-night bars if there‚Äôs still energy, but not too much since my travel to Osaka the next day.

**Days 3‚Äì6: Osaka**

* Day 3 (Oct 7): Taking the train to Osaka in the morning and checking in near Namba. Planning to explore Amerikamura for clothes since I‚Äôm packing light, have lunch at Kuromon Ichiba Market, and spend the evening in Shinsekai for kushi-katsu and izakaya hopping.
* Day 4 (Oct 8): Visiting the Yamazaki Distillery in the morning for the Monozukuri Tour & Tasting, which I won the lottery for. Hoping to pick up a nice bottle to bring home. The afternoon‚Äôs open for wandering, and I‚Äôd love to check out some Kitashinchi whisky bars at night if I can still look at whisky by then haha. Definitely open to hidden bar recommendations here.
* Day 5 (Oct 9): Umeda Sky Building in the morning, then Tenjinbashisuji arcade for snacks and lunch. Planning to explore the Tenma area in the evening for some proper izakaya hopping.
* Day 6 (Oct 10): Keeping this flexible. I might do a Kyoto side trip for Nishiki Market and Pontocho Alley, or just stay in Osaka,  grab some local food, and find a few small bars at night.

**Days 7‚Äì8: Kobe**

* Day 7 (Oct 11): Taking the train to Kobe in the morning and checking in. Planning to visit Meriken Park, Harborland, and Chinatown during the day. I‚Äôve got a reservation at Kobe Steak Ishida at 19:00, and after that I‚Äôd love to find some sake spots or bars.
* Day 8 (Oct 12): Thinking about visiting Nunobiki Herb Gardens or Mt. Rokko if the weather‚Äôs good. The afternoon‚Äôs pretty open, maybe wandering Kobe‚Äôs backstreets and caf√©s. Probably want to end the day with a small local brewery or sake bar if I can find a good one.

**Days 9‚Äì10: Kinosaki Onsen**

* Day 9 (Oct 13): Heading to Kinosaki and checking into a ryokan where breakfast and dinner are included. Planning to do the classic onsen-hopping route, take a seaside walk, and maybe try some sake tasting at Donmai.
* Day 10 (Oct 14): Full chill day in Kinosaki with breakfast at the ryokan, more onsens, a few naps, and a slow evening, dinner back in the ryokan. And check out the festival that is supposed to be going on.

**Days 11‚Äì13: Tokyo (Ueno)**

* Day 11 (Oct 15): Back to Tokyo and checking in at Ueno. Planning to browse Ameyoko Market, BerBerJin, Kapital, and Hinoya for vintage denim during the day. At night I want to check out Ebisu Yokocho for izakaya hopping, but I‚Äôm open to bar suggestions here.
* Day 12 (Oct 16): Visiting Koenji in the morning for record stores, thrift shopping, and local caf√©s. Spending the afternoon in Shimokitazawa to wander food alleys and vintage shops. In the evening, maybe a proper bar crawl around Koenji, Ebisu, or Shibuya depending on the mood.
* Day 13 (Oct 17): Exploring Nakameguro and Daikanyama for coffee spots and boutique shops. Planning an omakase dinner this evening, around ¬•45,000 but not booked yet, and probably finishing with a final nightcap in Golden Gai or a hidden whisky bar with some jazz and maybe cigars.
* Day 14 (Oct 18): Departure to home day :( Spending the morning on last-minute souvenir shopping, probably Shinanoya, Liquor Mountain, and Don Quijote. Might do a final stroll through Ueno Park or Ameyoko Market before heading to Haneda for my flight.

Hope anyone can either give some heads up or wake me up and check if its a doable experience. I've planned most of this through my experience in 2023 and asked ChatGPT to assist in some other places I haven't been before (Kobe and Kinosaki) I really loved Osaka en Tokyo.

When do you plan to travel? If the weather is going to be warm, highly encourage you to look up indoor kids playground. We took her to the one near Tokyo Dome and she didn't want to leave! Every few days we would take her to a playground (or indoor playground/cafe) so she could have some fun too..

She also enjoyed TeamLabs Planet ans Disney Sea... the rest (in terms of sights and shopping), she didn't care for.

You'll want to factor in timing if naps if you plan to do things late at night (like Shibuya Sky) too.","I think your Kyoto days look overpacked. Fushimi Inari and Monkey Park both require a lot of stairs/uphill climbing. Are also not near each other nor stroller friendly. 

I also wouldn't want to have to rush through Fushimi Inari or Gion. Give yourself time to explore them at your own pace without having to feel like you have to cut things short to squeeze in something else.","I travelled with my toddler, I had to scrap everything planned after 7pm, as it was so tiring and it does get to you.

If you‚Äôre in Harajuku, drop by Laforet too, I enjoyed it! - I‚Äôd also go to kiddyland - I didn‚Äôt have time to go kiddyland last time.

I‚Äôd skip Ueno zoo, but it‚Äôs Cus I wasn‚Äôt a fan.

If you have time on your Tokyo free day - I‚Äôd go to Shinjuku: the Disney flagship store is there.

Your Kyoto leg looks ok.

Your Osaka day trip is fine, but in the opposite, I‚Äôm spending most of my time at Osaka and day trip to Kyoto instead.

If you have time and your toddler is potty trained, there‚Äôs a great day use onsen not too far from the bamboo forest - tenzan no yu (by not far I mean 20-25 min walk)","If you can afford it, I would pick one central hotel for Tokyo and just eat the cost of the one night you‚Äôll spend at a Disney hotel.
We did that for our trip with our (then) 3 yr old and it was great not having to pack and unpack multiple times.

Plus - have you booked the Disney hotel already? If you‚Äôre going this October then it‚Äôs kind of late and there might be very few cheaper options.

I agree with the other poster - you are going to be wiped on Day 9. Fushimi is okay-ish with a stroller since you don‚Äôt have to go up but the Monkey Park requires you to walk up the hill and they didn‚Äôt let me bring my stroller along. My daughter got really tired very quickly and I had to carry her up and down. There are no guard rails on the trail so depending on your capabilities, it could be dangerous in that you could slip while holding your child.

Also be prepared for your child‚Äôs sleep schedule to change a little. That could throw out your plans if your child is extra tired and wakes up late or needs a nap in the middle of the day.",

Kamikochi - not sure if 2 nights might be too much? It‚Äôs an alpine valley and you can cover most of the hiking trails in a full day, or 1 night / 2 days might be good. Also consider nearby Hirayu Onsen which has good ryokan options. This is the main bus / transport hub in the area where you switch buses to get up to Kamikochi.

Matsumoto is lovely town and I would stay there a night or two. Also you will probably go via Nagano to Tokyo, so you may want to look around there. Togakushi Shrine area is majestic, and Zenkoji area is the main historical center. 

I just wrote a detailed post about going through this area (check my profile).","I second visiting Matsumoto, the castle is fascinating and the town itself is very chill and scenic with the surrounding mountains. From Matsumoto bus depot, you can take the Nohi Bus into the Alps for onsen in Okuhida, or ride the Shinhotaka Ropeway for gorgeous mountain views.",,,

",https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1n1jrb9/november_2026_3_week_itinerary/,"Day 11- The Nintendo Museum is in Uji, not Kyoto. You should check what you can visit or do there, like Byodo-in or drinking/buying matcha.

Day 12- Kyoto-Osaka is just a 30 minute normal train ride. If you take the shinkansen you have to then transfer to a different train at Shin-Osaka and ends up costing way more and taking around the same time.

Day 13- If you're going to Nara just for the park, it's a half day trip at most.

Day 15- You can stop at Himeji and visit the castle instead of going to Osaka castle the day before. You aren't visiting the Peace Museum in Hiroshima?

Day 16- Instead of Toshogu shrine, visit Mitaki-dera, which is not in the opposite direction of the outlets.

Hiroshima should be done between Kyoto and Osaka. That way you don't have a 4 hour trip back to Tokyo.","Day 11 - Noted that the museum is actually in Uji & not in Kyoto, and added Byodo-in

Day 12 - Great tip, thank you!

Day 13 - Anything else you‚Äôd recommend adding either in Nara or anything else we should make a point to do while in Osaka?

Day 15 - Are you recommending against Osaka castle completely and seeing Himeji instead? If we‚Äôre traveling from Kyoto to Hiroshima, would it be too much to visit Himeji, the peace memorial park/museum, and possibly Hondori shopping all on the same day?

I did swap it around so Hiroshima is now between Kyoto and Osaka, thank you for that tip. And I added Mitaki-dera instead as well",,,
1n1hjgb,Seeking feedback on November itinerary,"Hi! My husband and I are planning our first Japan trip this November (Nov 21‚Äì30). I‚Äôve put together an itinerary and would love your feedback. Here‚Äôs the plan--

DAY 1 {Arrival + Tokyo to Kawaguchiko}
*Land in Tokyo (Haneda) at 6:40am, forward luggage to Kyoto via Yamato > Head to Shinjuku for breakfast > Travel to Kawaguchiko via shinkansen/bus (~noon arrival)
*Afternoon: Lake Kawaguchi cruise, Mt. Fuji Ropeway, Oishi park, onsen
*Overnight stay in Kawaguchiko

DAY 2 {Kawaguchiko to Kyoto}
*Sunrise, scenic breakfast, and Chureito Pagoda in the morning 
*Go to Mishima > take Tokaido shinkansen to Kyoto (~4 hrs); alternatively take a bus
*Check in at Kyoto hotel (in Shimogyo Ward) by afternoon, pick up luggage (which should have reached by now)
*Evening stroll in Gion / Pontocho Alley

DAY 3  {Osaka sightseeing}
*Head to Osaka
*Osaka day trip (Osaka Castle > Shinsekai + Umeda Sky > Dotonbori street food + neon)
*Return to Kyoto in the evening 
*Note: This day is a holiday in Japan (Labour Thanksgiving day)

DAY 4 {Hiroshima day trip}
*Day trip to Hiroshima (Peace Memorial Park, Museum, Atomic Bomb Dome)
*Afternoon ferry to Miyajima (Itsukushima Shrine, Mt. Misen ropeway, if time)
*Return to Kyoto in the evening

DAY 5 {Kyoto sightseeing}
*Arashiyama Bamboo Grove > Tenryu-ji in the morning 
*Fushimi Inari, Sanjusangendo > Kiyomizu-dera + Higashiyama walk > Tea ceremony and dinner)

DAY 6 {Kyoto to Tokyo}
*Take shinkansen to Tokyo > Check in at the Tokyo hotel (in Taito ward)
*Explore Tokio National Museum (before 5pm), followed by Ueno Park >  Dinner in Ueno
*Note: This day is our second wedding anniversary <3

DAY 7 {Tokyo: Sightseeing}
*Morning: Asakusa (Senso-ji temple, Nakamise Street, Tokyo sky tree)
*Afternoon: teamLab Borderless
*Evening: Shibuya (Scramble, Mag's Park rooftop, Shibuya Sky at sunset, Meiji Jungu and evening stroll)
*Night: Dinner in Shinjuku (Golden Gai, Kabukicho neon), followed by a visit to Don Quijote Shinjuku 

DAY 8 {Tokyo: Disney Sea}
*Tokyo DisneySea; dinner inside the park
*Back to our hotel in Taito

DAY 9 {Tokyo: Shopping}
*Imperial Palace in the morning 
*Ginza: Uniqlo, Itoya, Tokyu Plaza, Loft
*Tokyo Station: Yaesu Shopping Mall
*Ueno: Ameyoko Market for last-minute souvenir/gift shopping

Day 10 {Departure}
*Lave for the airport by 7am to reach the Haneda airport by 8:15am > Fly out at 11:45am

Questions:
1. Does this pacing feel realistic or doable? Anything you'd like to add/subtract/modify? 
2. Are days 7 and 9 in Tokyo overstuffed? Should we skip Disney Sea on day 8 and redistribute the activities across days 7-9?

Thankyou! ^^",https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1n1hjgb/seeking_feedback_on_november_itinerary/,"In day 7 you have 4 different neighborhoods that aren't near each other except from Shibuya and Shinjuku.

The itinerary is extremely packed overall. You'll likely be running from place to the other and not be able to deviate or explore.

I'd drop the Kawaguchiko stay, go directly from Haneda to Kyoto and then do Kawaguchiko as a day trip from Tokyo, so you can choose which day you travel and be more certain that you'll be able to see Fuji. I'd add that extra day to Kyoto. I'd also drop Disney and add that day to anything else.","Hiroshima day may be very very hard and tiring. There is a direct ferry from peace park to miyajima, but it‚Äôs operations are related to tide, you need to check it out.

If Kyoto is your base, I hope your hotel is near Kyoto station - otherwise you will add a lot of time to every side trip for travel within Kyoto.

Budget up for cabs, with such a packed itinerary they will be necessary :)

DisneySea - check on line crowd calendar and go on a day that has lowest crowd estimate. Usually middle of the week. Taito to Disney is pretty far and you want to be there very early, plan ahead for that.","I would probably skip Kawaguchiko too and go straight to Kyoto. However I think you should leave your first day alot less packed than you planed. You will probably be reallt tired from the long flight, and trust me you won't be able to fully enjoy the day as you want to. In my experience leaving the first day kinda vague and don't plan to much is the best way to go, as you don't know your energy level and can get used to a different time zone as well.

I know, with only 9 days to explore Japan one tend to plan way too much for one day as a first timer. 
Day 5 and 7 are prime example of that.

Going from A to B in Kyoto takes significant more time than in Tokyo, and touristy places like Arashiyama and Kiyomizu get crazy busy, which slows you down as well. If you don't want to spend most of your time getting from location to location you have to make a prio list and see on what you manage to execute on these days.

When it comes to Tokyo sightseeing I would recommend not doing more than two districts in one day. Maybe skip teamlab? Skytree isn't as important to see as well in my opinion if you plan to go on shibuya sky as well.","Solid plan. A few tweaks to keep it smooth.

Day 1 works, but there is no shinkansen to Kawaguchiko. From Haneda go straight by bus, or train to Shinjuku then the highway bus. After an overnight flight, pick two things only in the afternoon, like Ropeway and Oishi Park, then onsen. Save the lake cruise if you have extra gas.

Day 2 is fine. Do Chureito at sunrise, then bus to Mishima and shinkansen to Kyoto. Gion in the evening is a good gentle walk.

Osaka on Nov 23 will be busy since it is a holiday, but still doable. Hiroshima as a day trip also works if you start early. If you are short on daylight, skip Mt Misen and just enjoy the shrine and town.

Back in Tokyo, the museum plus Ueno on Day 6 is realistic. For Day 7, split it up. Pair Asakusa with Skytree on one day. Put Meiji Jingu with Harajuku and Shibuya on another. TeamLab Borderless lives by Tokyo Tower at Azabudai Hills, so keep that as a separate half day with a timed ticket. Shibuya Sky at sunset also needs a timed slot, so do not stack it on the same day as teamLab.

Day 9 is fine if you start early. Imperial Palace East Gardens close some days, so double check the schedule. DisneySea is a full, fun day and fits well where you have it.

For Kawaguchiko, pick your clearest day for the best Fuji views. Use [isfujivisible.com](http://isfujivisible.com) to scan the week and grab the day that looks clear. It saves you from guessing.",

And I have a sneaking suspicion you're not going to adhere to that schedule one bit.,"You'd be better off sticking to one side of Tokyo: Asakusa-Ueno-Akhibara-Ginza or Shinjuku-Harajuku-Shibuya, roughly.

Crossing the city from one side to the other takes 30 min one way, you don't want that. For a first-timer I'd do the eastern side.

Forget about Owl cafes. I made the mistake of going to one 2 years ago, what was I thinking...owls have no business in a caf√©.","There is a lot to say:

1. The itinerary was constructed without taking into account fatigue after a transpacific flight, you hit the ground running while reality might be different

2. It has been done by someone who does not know Tokyo and has never been there and some timings are completely unrealistic (like 10 minutes from Harajuku to Shibuya by walking ??) or transfer wrong (why use the Yamanote to go to Yoyogi from Akihabara, it would takes 45 minutes instead of 30 which can be actually be done with a different transfer). 

3. Owl cafe and pretty much any animal cafe are animal cruelty. All you will see are drugged and apathetic owls that do not move due to depression. Those are very sad, very depressing and honestly you will feel worse after except if you do enjoy animal cruelty.

  
My advice : scrap this itinerary. Pick two areas that you would like to stroll around just to feel the vibe of the city with each something to see, for example Asakusa with Senso-Ji and Shinjuku for the neons and sheer madness. 

As for getting back, Haneda is well organized and in business class you will have fast track. It nevertheless can be busy so you should aim to be at the checkin counter no later than 2 hours before departure.","I feel like it may be a bit too much. 
Rather plan 3 distinct areas to go to
You've only got 16 hours, rushing and feeling like you overplanned isn't it, I've been there and it's not very nice.",

1n0vjau,Tohoku 12 days itinerary check,"Hi everyone,

In late September, my wife and I are heading to Tohoku for 12 days. It'll be my second trip to Japan and her third (she‚Äôs already been to Sendai, Matsushima, Shiogama, and Yamadera).

We‚Äôre flying into Sendai and flying out of Tokyo, so we‚Äôll need to end the trip somewhere with good Shinkansen access. The goal is to do some day hikes, soak in nature, and enjoy Japanese culture and food. We love temples, but they‚Äôre not the main focus this time. We'll mostly use public transportation, though we‚Äôre open to renting a car for a day if it makes a big difference.

After a lot of research, I put together an itinerary (below) that follows a south-to-north route along the Shinkansen line: staying in Sendai, then Morioka, then Aomori. But I‚Äôm wondering if we‚Äôll miss out by sticking mostly to larger cities. I‚Äôd also really like to spend one night in a ryokan in an onsen town ‚Äî but it‚Äôs been tricky to find one that fits the route and offers vegetarian meals (I‚Äôm vegetarian, but I do eat dashi when in Japan). If you know of any good vegetarian-friendly ryokan, or just a nice onsen town that could fit here, I‚Äôd love a recommendation!

Here‚Äôs the rough itinerary:

**Days 1‚Äì4: Based in Sendai**

* **Day 1:** Land in Sendai around noon. Either take a short trip to Matsushima or visit Zuihoden Mausoleum, the castle ruins, and the entertainment district.
* **Day 2:** Hike somewhere nearby ‚Äî maybe the Oku-Matsushima Olle Trail, Naruko Gorge, or Yamadera.
* **Day 3:** Visit either Yamadera or Mount Zao. I‚Äôm considering staying the night at Zao Onsen (I‚Äôve contacted a couple of ryokan about vegetarian meals), but I‚Äôm not sure if the long trip is worth it, even as a day trip. Any thoughts?

**Days 4‚Äì8: Based in Morioka**

* **Day 4:** Travel from Sendai to Morioka, stopping at Hiraizumi and Geibikei Gorge on the way. Does this seem doable in one day? If we end up staying in Zao Onsen the night before, we‚Äôd skip the stops and go straight to Morioka.
* **Day 5:** Day trip to Mount Akita-Komagatake and Lake Tazawa. Hoping to hike around the Moomin Valley.
* **Day 6:** Day trip to Miyako and Jodogahama Beach. Maybe also visit Kitayamazaki Cliffs or hike around Kesennuma ‚Äî though I‚Äôm not sure how realistic that is without a car.
* **Day 7:** Possibly Mount Hachimantai, Tono, or Kakunodate ‚Äî depends on the weather and our mood.

**Days 8‚Äì12: Based in Aomori**

* **Day 8 (Sunday):** Early train to Hachinohe. Visit the morning market and hike part of the Michinoku Shiokaze Trail (Hachinohe section). Then continue to Aomori. Is the market worth the early start?
* **Day 9:**  Hike Mount Hakkoda, probably with the ropeway. I also considered visiting Oirase Gorge and Lake Towada, but I‚Äôm not sure that‚Äôs feasible with public transport in one day. Is it too much? Would renting a car be a big help here?
* **Day 10:** Visit Osorezan. Planning to take the train to Mutsu, then either a bus or rent a car to explore the Shimokita Peninsula.
* **Day 11:** Either head to Hirosaki and Mount Iwaki, or visit the Takayama Inari Shrine.
* **Day 12:** Possibly explore Aomori City ‚Äî Nebuta Warasse Museum, Furukawa Fish Market ‚Äî or take the Shinkansen to Hiraizumi if we didn‚Äôt stop there earlier. Either way, we need to end the day in Tokyo.

I‚Äôd really appreciate any feedback, suggestions, or tips ‚Äî especially about logistics, vegetarian-friendly ryokan, or places that might be worth swapping in.

Thanks so much!",https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1n0vjau/tohoku_12_days_itinerary_check/,"Seems a bit overambitious. Public transport in Tohoku is quite sparse and you certainly won‚Äòt be able to visit multiple places a day.

Day 3: I don‚Äòt think Zao Onsen is particularly nice. It‚Äòs only famous for winter sports and snow monster so personally I might skip it in September.

Day 4: we spent the whole day in Hiraizumi but also rented bikes and went to Takkoku-no-iwaya bishamond≈ç. One of my highlights in Tohoku. We didn‚Äòt had time for the gorge.

Day 5: make sure you‚Äòre going to Akita-Komagotake on a weekend - the bus isn‚Äòt going up the mountain on weekdays anymore in September. Otherwise you‚Äòd have to rent a car.

Day 11: you‚Äôd need a car to visit Takayama Inari Shrine as well.

Day 9: There are only a handful of busses going from Aomori either to Mt Hakkoda or to Lake Towada. Also it‚Äòs around 3 hours by bus to reach Lake Towada so it would be better to stay the night if you want to visit both places.

I‚Äòd write down bus connections and transit times for each planned activity and decide if it‚Äòs doable.","I'd agree that this is *way* too much travel. Tohoku¬†is large and the public transport is infrequent by Japanese standards, so you can't move around like this.

Sendai needs 1-2 days. Morioka is actually a very interesting little city and needs at least a day.","Visited Tohoku thrice and it is better to rent a car especially in certain places including Lake Towada. You get to see more things with rented car. The traffic is in non-city area is quite good but hilly. 

Sendai:

Outside of Sendai. There's a lot to visit and I suggest you stay in Ryokan around there. (Rent a car)

Morioka: 

The places you wanted to visit are quite far even for driving. So better rent a car. Geibikei Gorge is a boat ride that will take about less than an hour excluding waiting.

Aomori:

Should try the market, I miss it the last time. You need to drive in Mount Hakkoda. You can see more things there. But I also recommend you to stay there for a night.

Tohoku is a huge area even for driving, try not to be ambitious. Use Google map and check on the time needed for driving and public transport. I use that a lot for my planning.",,

Thank you for reading! <3",https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1n0u366/late_autumn_itinerary_dec_02dec_15_osaka_kyoto/,"Day 6: This seems rather fast paced to me. Have you looked at travel times? Not just getting there from Osaka, but between places, like walking to the inner shrine, traveling to the wedded rocks, etc.

Day 7: This does look too heavy to me. Consider also that you might be tired from the previous day.

Day 11: I really like Kurashiki, I thought it was a fun place to shop. 

Day 12: This seems very travel heavy to me. Multiple trains and a ferry.

Day 13: That‚Äôs a pretty standard one day itinerary for Miyajima. The island is quite small and walkable.

Day 15: Is your flight later in the day (like after 3PM)? I wouldn‚Äôt risk being so far away in case of a train disruption the day the flight leaves. I would consider traveling to Osaka the night before just to make sure I didn‚Äôt miss the flight.","Day 9/10 - Depending on your ability, I'd recommend just renting a car for your time in Tottori City. Although it's possible to get around with public transit, Tottori prefecture is still very much a car-dependent location. Trains and buses can be slow and infrequent. For example, it will likely take about two hours to get to the Gosho Aoyama Manga Factory by train from Tottori Station (including about a 20-minute walk from Yura Station) while it only takes about 45 minutes by car. Likewise, having a car opens up the Tottori Sand Dunes, but also the nearby sights of Uradome Beach and Higashihama Beach. 

Driving around Tottori is really easy. I did a road trip around it. There's a toll-free highway through it. If you rent a car, I'd also recommend the hike up Nageiredo Temple, Japan's ""most dangerous"" temple hike (but it really isn't, don't worry).","Day 9 I would go directly to Yura station and do all the lunch/Conan stuff first. If you like Free!, Iwami is very close by as well. You could fit the sand dunes into Day 9, but either way Day 10 with sand dunes/museum/korakuen is very possible. Two gardens in Day 11 is a bit overkill? I made my way to Korakuen for a ""special nightlights"" show and found myself walking back and forth just to make going there worthwhile. Kurashiki is nice, worth a visit.. the vibe is like Yuehe street in Zhejiang. Day 13 is possible, imo a bit tight if you insist on walking everywhere. Miyajima is a small area and was more on the boring side for me.",,
1n19hdi,"4 days itinerary check - Tokyo, Kamakura, Hakone, Kawagoe - is this too ambitious?","My wife and I are spending four full days in the Tokyo area, with one day each for Tokyo, Kamakura, Hakone, and Kawagoe. We arrive at Haneda late the night before and depart from Narita after the trip.

Would love a second opinion on:

1. Evening food spots in Tokyo (we have three nights there).
2. Whether an anti-clockwise loop in Hakone makes more sense than clockwise.
3. Is Kawagoe a solid pick over a Fuji day trip, given we‚Äôll probably see Mt. Fuji from Kamakura/Hakone?

**Itinerary:**

* Arrival: Land at Haneda, head into the city, and stroll around Shibuya or Shinjuku.
* Day 1 (Tokyo): Skytree, Sensoji Temple, Nakamise Street, Akihabara or Harajuku/Meiji Shrine, Takeshita Street, Omotesando, Shibuya Crossing, Hachiko, Shinjuku Gyoen or Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building, Golden Gai.
* Day 2 (Kamakura): Ofuna ‚Üí Shonan Monorail ‚Üí Enoshima (Shrine, Sea Candle, local snacks), Enoden to Kamakura High School Mae (Slam Dunk spot), Shichirigahama (beach lunch), Hasedera Temple, Great Buddha, Tsurugaoka Hachimangu Shrine, Komachi Street.
* Day 3 (Hakone): Romancecar to Hakone-Yumoto, bus to Moto-Hakone, Amazake-chaya, Hakone Shrine, Lake Ashi cruise, Owakudani (ropeway, black eggs), museums/parks in Gora, onsen ryokan stay.
* Day 4 (Kawagoe): Train to Kawagoe, explore sights (Edo-era streets, Time Bell Tower, Kitain Temple, Hikawa Shrine), return to Tokyo.
* Departure: Early train to Narita Airport.

Let me know if you spot any issues or have tips!",https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1n19hdi/4_days_itinerary_check_tokyo_kamakura_hakone/,"You're trying to do in one day in Tokyo what people do in 2 or 3 days, this is impossible unless you want to spend very little time at each place. I can't give much advice about the day trips, but you need to drop something out of day 1, especially if you're flying from Europe or the US because you're probably going to be jet lagged. 

Place all of your itinerary (not just for day 1) on google maps and look at the travel times. You're probably underestimating the travel times between the different areas, and it does take energy, especially if you don't have much experience with huge subway systems. Like Hakone to Kawagoe is three hours, and you'll need to take the train back to Tokyo, that's half of your day gone.",Did you not count in travel time?seems extremely rushed and just not possible,"Day 1 is 3-4 days worth of activities. Combined with the request for food recommendations anywhere in the city, I suspect that you're forgetting that Tokyo is one of the largest cities in the world: you can't treat it like a small town in Europe or similar.","I know that maybe this is not a reply to your three questions, but....that Tokyo itinerary looks unhinged. You are going to rush from one place to the next staying there for 10 minutes and no time to enjoy any of it. It is also unclear of what it is that you actually want to do at those places. I guess you want a place to have a nice view from up high, but then why both Skytree and the Metropolitan Govt Building? One is enough. What do you want to do in Nakamise, Akihabara and Takeshita streets? They are all shopping areas, there will be quite some overlap probably, what are you planning to shop for? On your arrival day you already go to Shibuya, why go again on Day 1 to see the crossing and Hachiko?

Day 3 is equally packed, To go to the Amazake Chaya you need to take a bus. Why arrive in Moto-Hakone, take the bus, then take it back to go to the shrine and Ashi cruise? 

You need to consider that many shops and attractions close fairly early around 6-7pm. And you are wasting A LOT of time in public transport for such a short stay.

Why are you choosing to go to Kamakura, Hakone and Kawagoe, one each day during a short stay? Don't get me wrong, they are all lovely, but they are all on the ""traditional"" side of Japan. If that is your objective, I would choose one or maximum 2 of the three, and spend another day in Tokyo. 

I would suggest to think thoroughly what you want to extract from this trip, what your priorities are, and cut down a lot.",

**11.9 (arrival day)**

* Land at Narita Airport 12:30
* Train to Shibuya (hotel) ‚Üí probably there by 16:30‚Äì17:00
* Plan: eat well, rest, light stroll around Shibuya (Central Gai as an option)

**12.9**

* Morning at Meiji Jingu
* Takeshita Street
* Cat Street (walk back down to Shibuya)
* Shopping (Parco, 109, etc.)
* Dinner + evening in Shinjuku (Golden Gai, Memory Lane, arcades)

**13.9**

* Only plan for now:¬†*The Making of Harry Potter Studio Tour*¬†at 11:30

**14.9 (Sunday)**

* Oi Racecourse flea market (Sunday market)
* Ginza (Chuo-dori closed to cars on Sundays ‚Üí nice stroll)
* Tsukiji Market
* Odaiba (optional, depending on energy)

**15.9 (last full day)**

* Asakusa (start at Kaminarimon ‚Üí Shin-Nakamise ‚Üí Nakamise ‚Üí Senso-ji)
* Ueno Ameyoko shopping street
* Akihabara (mainly strolling around)

1n0jstu,Does this 8 day Japanese Alps Itinerary seem coherent to you?,"I'll land in Tokyo on the 25th of October. I thought i'd spend a week in Tokyo, then 8 days in the Japanese Alps before going down to Kyoto for 6 days. I was wondering if my Alps itinerary made sense and isn't a logistical nightmare. My main goals are to experience authentic architecture and culture, small mountain villages and onsen towns, try to avoid to crowds and do a couple of light to medium hikes as i love the outdoors. 

Here's how i planned it out :

- Day 1 : Train from Tokyo to Matsumo in the early morning.

> Visit the Castle in the afternoon 
> Walk around town. 

- Day 2 : Early bus to Kamikochi. 

> Check in, walk around the city.
> light hike along the river
> Onsen 

- Day 3 : Kamikochi - Full Hike day

> Start early morning for a longer hike. ( haven't decided yet but Dakesawa trail looks promising, though a bit short ) 
> Late afternoon bus to Takayama
> Ryokan if i can find something that fits in my budget.

- Day 4 : Takayama - I just love the vibe here. I added an extra day to relax

> Morning market strolls and taking it slow to explore the town
> Restaurant and Onsen in the evening.
> I hear a lot of things about Shirakawa-go, but from what i can gather, it is very small and often crowded. Don't know if it is worth checking it out in the morning.

 - Day 5 : Takayama to Nakatsugawa on wide view train.

> Bus to Magome after arrival.
> Hike Magome to Tsumago. 
> Experience the small post towns by night, and onsen.
> Either overnight in Tsumago, or continue on the Nakasendo to Nojiri. I hear it is quieter and less touristy, though i don't know about the accommodation options there.

- Day 6 : ( if overnight in Tsumago ) Hike to Nojiri, and on to Kyoto by train. 

Now, i am aware this is pretty hectic, but i thought 6 days in Kyoto afterwards will balance things out and allow me to relax a little bit more. 

As you can surely notice, there are only 6 days in this itinerary here. I have kept 2 extra days as bonus, to add wherever you see fit in order to space things out a bit better.

I have also been told that renting a car would make this itinerary much smoother, as buses can sometimes be erractic. I'm just hesitant about driving on the left side as i have never done that, and my preference would be to keep it to public transportation ... But if it will really make things better, i am willing to consider it.

I could really use some help from the experts around here. What would you do differently ? What would you simplify, add, retract ? 

Thanks a lot guys",https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1n0jstu/does_this_8_day_japanese_alps_itinerary_seem/,"There is no city, or even town, in Kamikochi. There are a few hotels spaced out along the river and a visitor center. But there are some nice opportunities for short hikes, of course. Having just visited there myself, the last bus to Takayama is at 5:30ish, but I recommend giving yourself a buffer. The queue of people waiting to go back was quite long, two buses left full before I was able to get on one. 

My recommendation for Takayama is once you‚Äôre done exploring the touristy, but undeniably beautiful, officially preserved area just get lost in any direction besides towards the train station and you will find really cool‚Äôs old buildings with absolutely no other tourists around. Most visitors stick to basically two streets in Sanmachi Suji.","We‚Äôve been to Kamikochi twice and the area three times. Our son lived near Okuhida for two years.

That‚Äôs a beautiful time of year. If the weather is clear, consider doing the ropeway as you can hike from the top for a high alpine experience. Otherwise your proposed hike is nice. Be aware that the trails that do all the way to the top of any of the mountains from the base get very steep.

Also, the onsen hotels near Okuhida are very reasonably priced and have great traditional breakfasts and multi course dinners.","You could use Hirayu Onsen or one of the other small towns in Okuhida as the base for exploring Kamikochi for those 2 days. This would allow you to use the onsen in the evening , since the last bus out of Kamikochi leaves quite early. 

Hida folk village is much smaller than shirakawa go but super accessible from Takayama and might scratch that same itch.",I would arrive in Kamikochi down the day then spend an entire second day then get a bus out the 3rd day. Kamikochi has been the best thing I‚Äôve seen in Japan/ the world. Give yourself enough time to enjoy it. Also book your ryokan in Kamikochi early (4 months out at the latest). I really enjoyed hiking mount yakedake. But it is a full day affair so it may not work out unless you stay overnight 2 nights in Kamikochi,

I'm planning a trip in October and I could really use some advice. We want to do the Golden Route, but also try to add in one or more of the following:

* An onsen stay for 1-2 nights. Anywhere near the Mt. Fuji area, Atami, Kinosaki Onsen or Misasa Onsen
* Okayama. This area looks beautiful and I would love to see the garden and Kurashiki.
* Naoshima Island 

My current itinerary is:

Day 1 - Tokyo:

* Arrival, hotel check-in, & dinner

Day 2 - Tokyo:

* Explore Asakusa: Senso-Ji temple and Nakamise-Dori Street
* Kappabashi
* Have dinner and spend the evening in Shinjuku 

Day 3 - Tokyo:

* Disney Sea

Day 4 - Tokyo:

* Day trip to Kamakura and possibly Enoshima

Day 5 & 6 - Osaka:

* I'm still working on this itinerary but want to do lots of vintage shopping, see Dotonbori, Osaka Castle, Namba Yasaka Shrine, and Tennoji Park. I'm also considering adding an extra day to possibly see Katsuo-ji temple or Universal Studios. 

Day 7 - Kyoto:

* Note: Try to get there super early to drop off our luggage at the hotel. This day might be a little ambitious as a travel day but it appears Osaka and Kyoto are very close. 
* Fushimi Inari 
* Visit 3 other nearby temples: Komyo-in, Tofukuji Funda-in, and Unryu-in

Day 8 - Kyoto:

* Yasaka Pagoda
* Kiyomizu-Dera Temple
* Ninenzaka and Sannenzaka
* Kodaiji Temple 
* Lunch
* Kenninji Temple
* Spend the afternoon biking the Philosopher‚Äôs Path and make a stop at Konchi-in Temple and Tenjuan gardens

Day 9 - Kyoto:

* Arashiyama and Tenryu-ji temple
* T≈çji Temple
* Have dinner and spend the evening in the Pontocho Geisha District

Day 10 - Kyoto:

* Kinkaku-ji
* Genko-an temple 

Day 11 - Tokyo:

* Travel day back to Tokyo 

Day 12 - Tokyo:

* Tsukiji Market
* Flight back home later on in the day

  
I was initially thinking I could include 2 nights between Tokyo and Osaka for an onsen stay in either Atami or Mt Fuji area. Then I came across Kinosaki and Misasa onsen towns. These look especially beautiful and now I can't decide which to go with! 

I also just learned about Okayama and Naoshima, but I'm not sure if this would all be too difficult to include. I could include it after Kyoto or between Osaka and Kyoto, but again I'm not sure what would logistically make sense.

Please note that none of our flights/hotels are booked yet, so I am extremely flexible with dates right now. Hoping to have everything figured out within the next week or so. 

Any advice is greatly appreciated!! Thank you :) ",https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1n0dp3v/japan_itinerary_help/,You're booking pretty last minute tbh. Hotels were already filling up when I was booking for October back in June. You should probably get your flights and hotels booked ASAP. And a private onsen stay is gonna be tricky to find. Again all the popular/affordable ones will have been booked up by now. I was having trouble finding an opening when looking. Good luck with your planning,"Osaka and Kyoto are really close, so you could book an hotel on either (maybe Kyoto since you're planning to do more days there) so you don't have to check-in and out. 

I personally loved Kinosaki, I'd recommend going there from Kyoto. I've got some big tattoos and they're allowed there so it was a plus. You'd need to stay for a night for it to be enjoyable, I can recommend Morizuya, it's a lovely ryokan, they get you dressed with a yukata so you can get the full onsen town experience and also have a private small bath you can reserve for free for an hour.


If you enjoy amusement parks USJ is great, try to be there on a weekday though.","I very recently went to Okayama and did a day trip to Naoshima. I absolutely loved Okayama! It was a nice city and the garden + castle were awesome! Plus kurashiki was really nice to walk through!

I have to say I would not recommend Naoshima unless you are really into modern art. Most of the museums are small and expensive in comparison to other museums in Japan so unless you really want to see something I would definitely skip! I wish I had spent that day in Okayama.

If you were interested in fitting it in then you could go straight there from Tokyo and come back east through Osaka/Kyoto but there's so much to do in those places too!",,

All tips appreciated!",https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1n0isj8/first_time_to_japan_i_have_17_days_to_play_with/,Why not shop when you're in Harajuku and Shibuya for the first time insteadt of backtracking two days later?¬†,"Seems fine. All I can suggest is that you turn it around - enter via KIX, start at Osaka and then end in Tokyo. Lets you do the shopping at the end so you dont have to lug it around, plus it ends your trip on a high note.

Tho I am surprised to see 7 days allocated to Osaka. But with all those daytrips, I suppose it makes sense.","If you don‚Äôt know which ryokan to stay in hakone yet, I suggest Kansuiro annex. It was amazing. Tattoo friendly as well if you have tattoos. Can get pricy but I think it‚Äôs worth","I'd make 2 suggestions:

-  if you're going to be coming in Jetlagged, then start at Kyoto. It's where most things open early and going early means dodging crowds.

- think about whether you want to modify your Osaka daytrips to potentially do an overnight at Hiroshima (combo stopover with Himeji quite doable). The peace park is nice, Hiroshima city has a cool vibe and Miyajima is absolutely wonderful.

We did 1 TYO -> 6 KYO -> 2 OSA -> 1 HIR -> 2 OSA -> 5 TYO (just signalling our nights here) last year and it worked out pretty well for us.",
1n04q91,Itinerary Check for 17/10 - 07/11 (22 days - NOT including travel),"APOLOGIES IN ADVANCE FOR THE LENGTH - Finalising my itinerary and wanting to check it doesn't seem too wild/there isn't anything I didn't consider that might be a massive show stopper. Key things you might want to know:

*  We're a couple in our mid/late 30s (with tattoos we can't easily cover)
* This is our 4th trip to Japan
*  I'm aware the first week or so is quite full on and more heavily planned (we have some flexibility and I worked out the timings, I just didn't write it all down)
* We are quite fast paced travellers and don't tend to enjoy too much ""down time"".  We function quite well going to bed later and still getting up early. Husband is a morning person so tends to get up very early (7:30ish) and I normally am between 8:00-8:30.
* Flights and accommodations are all paid for. Accommodations are all cancellable until close to the time (so we *could* shuffle if needed).
* Overall we are foodies, love craft beers (and cocktails/spirits), anime/manga, video games, general nerdiness (example - we like to buy and build Gunpla Gundams), and Japanese culture in general. We're pretty much open to trying new and/or unique experiences and money is (fortunately) not much of a limitation.

I've got some questions that I'll pop down at the end, but the biggest question is just a sense check around the following (I can shuffle a few bits around but if you have any obvious suggestions for what makes better sense, please do tell me):



# Day 0 (Thurs, 16/10)  - Fly out of LHR

# Day 1 (Fri, 17/10) - Arrive at Haneda

* Land at 7:15. We'll forward our bags to Sendai (Day 9)
* Plan is to see how we're feeling, how quickly we can get out/send bags, and what the state of play is and then will *either*:
   * Go to DisneySea to eat all the thematic food from food stalls (this is the crazier option that is less likely to happen, but it's not a ""no"" - we aren't fussed about rides, it's more the principle as every trip I've said I'd go to DisneySea and haven't). If we do this. we'll by leaving around 18:00 , if not earlier (19:00 at the *absolute* latest), to get to Nagoya (\~2hr 30 mins)
   * Go directly to Nagoya (\~2 hr 15 mins). If we go directly to Nagoya, we'll just play it by ear in terms of exploring the area.
* Check-in to hotel, eat (if needed), and go to bed



# Day 2 (Sat, 18/10) - Nagoya

* Slow start (depending on how we're feeling) / grab coffee
* **AM -** Sekigahara (could move this to ""tomorrow"" and have a full day for a day trip)
* **PM** \- TBC (open to suggestions)



# Day 3 (Sun, 19/10) - Nakatsugawa

* Check out/grab coffee
* **AM** \- TBC (open to suggestions)
* **PM** \- Nakatsugawa (where we're staying for the night). Plan to get a relatively early night as we'll be doing the Nakasendo the next few days with early morning rises.

# Day 4 (Mon, 20/10) - Nakasendo 1

* Grab coffee & walk Nakatsugawa --> Ochiai --> Magome-juku (alternative plan is to grab the bus to Ochiai if needed for some reason). Plan to be up/out/walking by 8:30.
* Explore Magome for 60-90 mins
* Walk Magome --> Tsumago-juku
* Explore Tsumago for 60-90 mins
* Depending on the timings, we either walk or take the bus from Tsumago --> Nagiso
* Train from Nagiso --> Kiso-Fukushima (aiming to get the 18:16 that will arrive in KF at 19:13)
* Check-in to accommodation, eat, early night

# Day 5 (Tues, 21/10) - Nakasendo 2

* Wake up, grab coffee, and explore KF
* Catch 11:03 train KF --> Yabuhara (arrive at 11:19). Next train isn't for a while after, so this is non-negotiable
* Walk Yabuhara --> Narai-Juku
* Explore Narai-juku (\~2-4 hours)
* Train from Narai --> Matsumoto
* *Depending on timing/our mood, optional stop in Shiojiri for Sake tasting, or go to hotel in Matsumoto to check in, then come back to Shiojiri*
* Check in/shower
* Grab dinner and walk around the castle area in the evening (here it's nice in the evening).

# Day 6 (Weds, 22/10) - Matsumoto

* Get up, grab a coffee, and rent car (plan to be with car by 9:00)
* Day trip to Kusatsu Onsen
* Leave Kusatsu around 16:30/17:00
* Late(ish) dinner (if we didn't already eat) and drinks

# Day 7 (Thurs, 23/10) - Aizu-Wakamatsu

* Check out/grab coffee
* Finish up Matsumoto (depending on the previous days, we may have done some of the other bits already)
   * Castle (priority first thing)
   * Nawate/Frog Street
   * Nakamachi Street
   * Kurassic-Kan
* Grab food/snacks and travel (public transport) from Matsumoto --> Aizu-Wakamatsu
* Check into onsen (Harataki) and spend the rest of the day soaking and relaxing (they seem to be tattoo friendly from all we can tell, but if for some reason that has changed and it's not clear, we have a private bath in our room and can rent their private baths as well).

# Day 8 (Fri, 24/10) - Aizu-Wakamatsu

* **AM** \- explore Aizu-Wakamatsu
* **PM** 
   * Lunch in Kitakata
   * Finish up anything remaining in A-W 
   * More soaking in the evening

# Day 9 (Sat, 25/10) - Sendai

* Early(ish) wake up and quick final soaks
* Grab coffee and/or walk around if there's any last minute things remaining
* Train from A-W --> Nihonmatsu (tentatively planning to make the 10:55 train that will get us there by 12:17)
* Explore Nihonmatsu - currently Ebisu circuit is the main POI (as my husband is a Japanese car guy and we think the drift course could be cool)
* Train from Nihonmatsu --> Sendai (targeting the 17:13 train that gets us in at 18:25)
* Check into hotel and grab dinner/drinks (no early morning is needed and less scheduled moving forward....

# Days 10-16 (Sun, 16/10 - Sat, 01/11) - Sendai

* Currently working out the best flow and day trips/half day trips. Nothing set in stone, we're just going to go with what we feel like on a particular day, but currently looking at doing the following across the days
   * **AM** \- Morioka / **PM** \- Sendai
   * **AM** \- Yamadera / **PM** \- Ginzan Onsen --> Yamagata (we very well might remove Ginzan or Yamagata - looking into it, it does seem busy but achievable as we don't have any ""can't be missed"" spots in Yamagata)
   * **Full Day** \- Matsushima Bay (unsure if we need a full day or a half day. Might just need just over a half day and finish in Sendai)

# Day 17 (Mon, 02/11) - Tokyo

* Travel back from Sendai --> Tokyo. No set time we plan on leaving or need to arrive in Tokyo, sort of playing it by ear a bit.
* Plan to stop in Fukushima City on the way back. Open to any other stops that are easy on the way back instead?
   * Ideally wanted to do a tour exploring the impacted areas from the 2011 disaster and the growth that's happened since, but the one tour I found that covered what I was wanting to see (educational, not just dark tourism) had no availability and I haven't been able to find anything since.

# Day 18 - 22 (Tues, 03/11 - Fri, 07/11) - Tokyo

* We're staying in Koenji and want to try to explore the ""lesser travelled"" areas of Tokyo while also visiting our favourite spots (appreciate nowhere is really ""Lesser travelled"", but just mean not Shinjuku, Shibuya, Ginza, etc. etc.)
* Planning to do some day trips. We've done Enoshima/Kamakura/Yokohama/Kawasaki already on past trips as well as staying in Hakone. This time we're considering Fuji area.
* Husband is looking to rent a JDM and drive on one of the days (or at least half day). This might bring us towards the Saitama area as this was one branch he knew had the car he wanted to rent. Any particularly good drives people can recommend? (He's already all over it, but thought I'd also ask just in case)
* Last day (7th) we'll probably be dedicating that to shopping, packing, and prioritising any final stops we can't miss.

# Day 23 (Sat, 08/11) - FLY HOME

* Early morning flight home (thankfully landing on the same day so we have Sunday to recover and be sad!)

Questions:

\- I understand there's not a lot in Nagoya. Any experiences or ""must see"" spots you most recommend that might get overlooked when google searching/reading threads?

\- Debating whether or not we should do Ghibli park. We did the Ghibli museum in Tokyo years ago and I really enjoyed it, but for some reason Ghibli Park doesn't excite me the way I'd expect it to. I heard it's not worth it if you don't have access to *all* the sites and a lot of the reviews I've seen are families (with children) or people that live and breathe Ghibli. I enjoy Ghibli films but wouldn't say I'm *that* hardcore and I'm not bothered about exclusive merch. Is it worth going as two adults without kids?

\- Day 2 I've tentatively pencilled in Sekigahara, but we could be flexible and shuffle it to the morning on Day 3 to give ourselves a full day to do something else using Nagoya as a base. Any suggestions of how to use either that full day **or** a half day after Seki?

\- Day 3 we're staying in Nakatsugawa. I don't have a lot of things I personally was needing/wanting to do here, just easiest place to base before doing Naksendo. Anything not to be missed that I might not find easily? Or should I be just going there to eat/sleep and focus time somewhere else close by for most of the day?

\- Currently at least 4 full days without any rough idea/plan using Sendai as a base. Any suggestions for good day trips?? (Ideally 2 hours absolute max away). We can rent a car if need (already have international license) as long as it's a good use of time/money (and not just something to spend a short time at/can easily get the train to). 

\- Asked before but didn't really get a response, any recommendations for good tours or self guided tours/suggestions for covering some of the disaster sites in/around Fukushima? Not really interesting in the reactor or anything - I'm wanting to ideally have a guided tour where they can explain what happened, educate, and then show around regeneration of the area(s).

\- Genuinely not a lot on our radar for Tokyo. Any suggestions for day trips for 4th timers? We've done the usual already  (Yokohama, Enoshima, Kamakura, Hakone, etc.)

\- What are your favourite lesser travelled areas within Tokyo? For example, I don't feel like enough people were talking about Shimokita before I went there in 2023 so it was a pleasant surprise (we even found a beer festival!) and I would recommend that spot to anybody - especially craft beer lovers.

",https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1n04q91/itinerary_check_for_1710_0711_22_days_not/,"Nagoya day trip ideas:  
\- Inuyama if you are a castle person (but you visit Matsumoto Castle, which may be a slimilar experience). Meiji-Mura Museum and Monkey Park if you are interested.  
\- Ise Jingu is easy access from Nagoya by Meitetsu, if you are a shrine person. This is THE Shrine of shrines.  
\- Himakajima Island if you are an octpus person. A short ferry ride.  
\- Toyota Motor Museum if you are a car person  
\- Tajimi and Toki if you are a pottery/ceramic person  
\- Takayama and Shirakawago - it's a major tourist place but lots of day tours depart from Nagoya  
\- Korankei Gorge/Chausuyama highlands/Mt Horaiji if you are a nature person - October may be a bit too early for autumn colours but still pretty",,,,
1mzvel0,Okinawa Honeymoon Advice: July or October trip?,"We are planning our honeymoon for Japan for next year and we are having a hard time figuring out when it's best to go to Okinawa. We are planning to do Ishigaki, Iriomote, and Taketomi, and are thinking of either going in early July or early October.

This is what we have gathered so far and are conflicted. Would appreciate any thoughts and opinions on when the better time is to go. Thank you in advance for your help!

July (first two weeks):

* Pros: Lower chance of rain & hotter (I think that's a pro for the beach, but maybe it'll be too hot?)
* Cons: Typhoon risk is higher

October (first two weeks):

* Pros: Lower typhoon risk & fewer tourists
* Cons: Higher chance of rain, cooler (high 70s/low 80s), and not all tourist activities in full swing (have seen some hotels close water sports by end of September)

Day 1: Tokyo 

* Land in Tokyo 
* Relax & then go clubbing in the evening 

Day 2: Tokyo

* Shopping around Ginza

Every trip we've done has either been late Sept --> October or October --> early Nov and October is typically still warm (where we could wear shorts) but without it being so unbearable like it is in July. Just did a quick google and it looks like Okinawa in early October does go up to high 80s on average during the day time. When googling average temp in early July in Okinawa, it looks like the daytime high goes up to 89F (was showing as 87F average for early Oct), so only a few degrees difference.



 Personally, my unsolicited 2p is that I'd avoid typhoon risk if possible as what good is the few extra degrees of heat if you're dealing with typhoons? And then for Tokyo, you'll be dealing with humidity as well as the rain. For me, Oct has very little downside.","I've actually been to Okinawa in November, so arguably 'worse' than October. Weather was fine, I dont recall it raining at all. Not as warm as peak summer but still comfortable weather for Tshirts and shorts. You're right that theres not as much water sports as durinf summer, but there were still plenty of snorkelling and scuba activities available. Water is colder than in summer of course but nothing too unbearable.",Its kinda like hawaii but cheaper,,
1mzt9q6,Karuizawa without a car,"Hi all, looking to go to Karuizawa in late October with my mom. We will likely be travelling from Tokyo by Shinkansen and are thinking of spending two nights in Karuizawa before returning to Tokyo.

Can you see Karuizawa without a car? Looking to see the main spots like Kumoba Pond, Shiraito Waterfall, potentially looking to stay at Hoshino.

Not looking to pack our days there with too much activity as we want to relax.

Thanks in advance.


",https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1mzt9q6/karuizawa_without_a_car/,"Please note that there are two train stations and two ""main"" areas of Karuizawa. If you look at Google Maps, Karuizawa area is to the east, and Nakakaruizawa is to the west. They are about 4-5 kms apart, so not really walkable one to the other. 

There‚Äôs Karuizawa Station, which is the shinkansen station. This is within walking distance to Karuizawa Ginza, Kumoba Pond, and Karuizawa Prince outlet mall. This is the more convenient area to stay if you don't have a car. 

Then, the next local stop on the train line is Nakakaruizawa station. This is NOT within walking distance of the Pond, the Ginza, or anywhere near Karuizawa Station amenities.

TO NOTE: Hoshino Resort Karuizawa is 25 mins walk from **Nakakaruizawa Station**. This hotel complex is NOT within walking distance of *Karuizawa* Station or any of the above amenities. 

If you are visiting without a car (which I do every couple of years) I recommend looking only in the Karuizawa area, and not look at Nakakaruizawa. You can pop over there in a cab, easily, but if you are going to see the Ginza and Kumoba Pond, look only near Karuizawa Station.

I personally like Hotel Rosso, for its location near the shinkansen station, and Hotel Karuizawa Cross, up near the Ginza. But there's heaps of hotels for all budgets.

To go to Shiraito Falls, you could grab a cab. It's absolutely not walkable for the casual walker (11 kms), and the bus is not especially regular, depending on the time and day (although as with everything in Japan, if it says it's due, it will arrive. It's clean and reliable, it just doesn't run very often).","There is a bus to visit the waterfall, it‚Äôs kind of infrequent but manageable. The pond and shopping street are within walking distance of the shinkansen station. It depends on if your lodgings are close to the areas of interest or if they offer a shuttle to the station, etc. I didn‚Äôt use a car or taxi when I visited a few years ago.",I see lots of people around Karuizawa riding e-bikes. I guess they're available for rent. Quicker than walking - although the road to Shiraito falls is closed to cycles.,"A car is definitely convenient in Karuizawa. I've been there two times in the last two years, once for skiing and once for sight seeing. Both times I had a car and I valued it. The pond is walkable, the old town shopping district is also within walking distance, as is the outlet mall. But most other things need a car. You could take the bus, but you lose convenience and time. Here's an idea:  there's a car rental agency right in town, I think it's Budget, so you could still take the train into Karuizawa and then rent a car for the day while there.",

1n0490k,Itinerary and Suggestions - Siblings 13 Days in Japan,"Hello,

My sister and I are going to Japan from October 4th to the 18th and we've got most of the trip locked down. Figured I would run it by ya'll to make sure we didn't over/under plan for it. Since I was in charge of all the planning, I made a few goofs that are going to require us to get creative with our luggage, but I'm sure it will all work out. We're both in our 30s, and we'll have a backpack and suitcase (medium sized) going out, and coming back with two suitcases. We are doing that ""suitcase in a suitcase"" thing that everyone recommends. Additionally, we both have tattoos and understand the ramifications of that (no onsen.) It's my second time in Japan, and her first time.

* **Evening** - *Not sure yet, taking suggestions*

**Day 9 - October 12th - Kyoto - Tokyo** 

* **Morning** - Saiho-ji Temple at 10:30am (This is where I messed up again. We'll likely have to store our luggage in a locker. We have considered doing luggage forwarding on day 7 to our hotel in Tokyo to arrive today. Let me know your thoughts...)

Only thing I am stuck on is if I should get the Shinkansen tickets now, or wait til we're on our Layover in LAX on the 4th. Thoughts?",https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1n0490k/itinerary_and_suggestions_siblings_13_days_in/,"I see some amount of backtracking (Tokyo to Osaka, then back to Kyoto, then to Hiroshima then back to Kyoto and Osaka, and then to Tokyo). It would probably be more efficient to just head to Hiroshima first and then go eastwards, though I assume you've already booked hotels and don't really want to change it up too much at this point.

Having said that, have you looked into a domestic flight from Narita to KIX/Itami/Kobe? If you can get to Osaka on the same day you arrive in Japan, you can leave your bags at the hotel.

You might already be aware of this, but if you are bringing a larger suitcase onto the shinkansen that doesn't fit between your legs and the seat in front of you, you need to book certain seats that have a luggage section.","Some hotels will let you store luggage before check in :) Also second the above commenter, please for the love of god reserve a shinkansen ticket with luggage space (best to do ASAP once you're settled and at a train station). I can't count the amount of times we've specifically reserved a seat with luggage space and found another tourist has put their suitcase there (despite signs in English on the floor and announcements at every stop)","Don‚Äôt go to owl or other animal cafes if you value animal welfare.

You should be able to leave your luggage at hotels before checking in.",Why not just fly straight  to Osaka?,
1mzqwv4,14 Day Japan Itinerary,"Hello everyone!

I‚Äôll be traveling to Japan from **October 17th to November 1st**, and I‚Äôd love some advice on my itinerary.

**Priorities:** I love the beach, so visiting Okinawa and the surrounding islands is very important to me. I also really enjoy matcha and temples, which is why I‚Äôve chosen Kyoto as my base.

* A friend mentioned it‚Äôs not worth staying overnight in Fuji or Hakone, and suggested I move one of those nights to Okinawa instead. Do you agree?
* The matsuri festival is going on while I'm in Japan.. I added it to my itinerary instead of leaving for Okinawa that day. Is it worth it?
* Other notes: I‚Äôll stop in Osaka on my way back after Okinawa. Should I stay here a night before heading to Kyoto?

**Here‚Äôs my current itinerary:**

* **Oct 17 (Fri):** Arrive in Tokyo (Asakusa/Ueno base) 4:00 pm. Evening stroll around Senso-ji Temple and Nakamise-dori.
* **Oct 18 (Sat):** Kawagoe Matsuri Festival (day trip). Floats, lanterns, Candy Alley, Hikawa Shrine, and street food ‚Üí return to Tokyo at night.
* **Oct 19 (Sun):** Fly to Okinawa (Naha). Explore Shuri Castle and Kokusai-dori in the evening.
* **Oct 20 (Mon):** Okinawa day trip ‚Üí Cape Manzamo, Hiji Waterfall, and Emerald Beach.
* **Oct 21 (Tue):** Ferry to Tokashiki Island (Kerama Islands) for snorkeling + beach. Return to Naha.
* **Oct 22 (Wed):** Fly Naha ‚Üí Osaka Itami, then transfer to Kyoto. Evening stroll in Gion and Pontocho Alley.
* **Oct 23 (Thu):** Day trip to Uji (Byodoin Temple + matcha tastings). Afternoon hike through Fushimi Inari Shrine.
* **Oct 24 (Fri):** Kyoto exploration ‚Üí Philosopher‚Äôs Path, hidden temples, Nishiki Market, Kiyomizudera at sunset.
* **Oct 25 (Sat):** Day trip to Nara: Todaiji Temple, Kasuga Taisha, Deer Park, and Mt. Wakakusa hike. Return to Kyoto.
* **Oct 26 (Sun):** Kyoto ‚Üí Fuji (Kawaguchiko). Morning in Arashiyama Bamboo Grove + Monkey Park. Afternoon Shinkansen to Mishima, bus to Kawaguchiko. Ryokan check-in.
* **Oct 27 (Mon):** Fuji day ‚Üí Chureito Pagoda, Lake Kawaguchi, Momiji Tunnel (autumn foliage). Optional trip to Obuchi Sasaba tea fields for tea + Mt. Fuji views.
* **Oct 28 (Tue):** Transfer Kawaguchiko ‚Üí Hakone. Explore Lake Ashi cruise, Hakone Shrine, ropeway to Owakudani volcanic valley. Stay in an onsen ryokan.
* **Oct 29 (Wed):** AM transfer Hakone ‚Üí Kamakura. Visit Great Buddha, Hasedera Temple, Komachi-dori street, and coastal walk to Enoshima. Evening train to Tokyo.
* **Oct 30 (Thu):** Tokyo exploration ‚Üí Meiji Shrine, Harajuku (Takeshita Street), Omotesando, Shibuya Crossing, and TeamLab Planets in the evening.
* **Oct 31 (Fri):** Free day in Tokyo ‚Üí options: Ginza shopping, Akihabara (anime & gaming), Daikanyama caf√©s. Final sushi dinner.
* **Nov 1 (Sat):** Departure day 5:00 pm Train/bus ‚Üí airport.
   * Should I trim a night from Fuji/Hakone and add it to Okinawa? Or leave them as day trips in general?
   * Any tips for dining without reservations (especially in Kyoto and Tokyo)?
   * One night in Osaka before heading to Kyoto?
   * Restaurant recommendations are always welcome!

Thanks so much for all of your help!!",https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1mzqwv4/14_day_japan_itinerary/,"Great plan and perfect season. If beaches are a priority, shift one night from Fuji/Hakone to Okinawa. I‚Äôd keep exactly one overnight between Kawaguchiko or Hakone and do the other as a day trip. I run [isfujivisible.com](http://isfujivisible.com), so my rule is simple: only lock the Fuji night if the cams and 8-day forecast look good the day before; if not, day trip or skip and save the time for Kyoto or Okinawa.

Kawagoe Matsuri is worth it. Go early, enjoy the floats after dark, then back to Tokyo.

No need to sleep in Osaka before Kyoto. Itami to Kyoto is an easy transfer; add Osaka at the end like you planned.

Okinawa days look busy for public transport. Rent a car or trim the list so you are not racing the clock. Book the Kerama ferry in advance and watch sea conditions.

One routing tweak: Arashiyama plus Monkey Park in the morning, then transfer to Kawaguchiko the same day is a slog. Move Arashiyama earlier in the Kyoto block, and in Kawaguchiko focus on Chureito, Oishi Park, lakeside strolls, and Momiji Corridor; skip Obuchi Sasaba unless you have a car. For dining without reservations, eat early or late, line up before opening, and lean on ramen, udon, curry, conveyor sushi, or department-store food halls when plans change.","Going to Hakone and not staying a night at ryokan, as your friend suggested, is like going to cinema to only get popcorn and not to watch a movie. Sure, you can do it. Would I recommend it? Absolutely not.

Dining: do not only search for 5 stars restaurants, 4 stars in Japan are also absolutely fantastic and 3 stars are still quite good. Your time is precious, waiting in lines to get a special experience is not worth it. Book in advance what you MUST eat but then do not bother.

Pretty packed one, GLHF.",You‚Äôre changing location about 12 times in a 16 day trip. This looks like too much travel.,,

Day 9 is ambitious,  all of that is far from each other.  Travel time eats into it.","Wow that is a lot. I like to book hotels with onsens or with at least a soaking tub in the room, it helps after a long day of walking all over the place. And for your day 11, assuming there is a day 12 for departure from HND, you can take some things from earlier in the itinerary and do them on day 11. Also, if you have Priority Pass, get to HND early to explore the airport, they also have a 24/7 rooftop onsen.",,

is there any place i should go instead or cut one day out and put it somewhere else? as well im 20 and looking to experience the city life but also want to spend time outside the hectic areas and enjoy the nature of japan. any reccomendations please",https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1n08dxz/should_i_change_anything/,"Did you plan this trip with ChatGPT? I can start to see a certain pattern with itineraries recently... especially the ""Takayama: explore old town sake breweries"" part and the emojis...

What do YOU wanna see? Any specific things that interest you, eg. Pokemon, Chiikawa, Snoopy, Moomin, Sanrio, Ghibli? Maybe start with that.

Also, Ueno is pretty big, there is the park itself, the zoo in the park, Tokyo National Museum etc. Condensing all of that into one word ""Ueno"" isn't very helpful. What do you wanna see there?","Line breaks please!!!

Overall this is a well-organised itinerary. Just some small points:

Day 1: As a local I have to tell you that Shinjuku at night is overrated, and there [are many other](https://www.timeout.com/tokyo/restaurants/tokyo-alleyway-guide) nighttime food and drink spots that are far less touristed than Omoide Yokocho or the rest of Kabukicho. But if you're staying in the area, then yes it makes sense to take it easy and wander around Shinjuku on your first night.

Day 4: You can add Meiji Jingu to the start of this day, it opens very early.

Day 4: Thrifting in Tokyo is [much misunderstood](https://www.reddit.com/r/TokyoTravel/comments/1hweyq6/comment/m60p30y/?context=3), and you may not want to bother. However, Shimokitazawa is absolutely worth visiting for [the best live music scene on Earth](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/14sum76/how_to_access_live_music_in_japan_and_why_it/).

Day 5: I would put Kamakura over Kawagoe as a day trip option. The entire area is beautiful, more than just Kawagoe's small 'old town', and in December the skies may be clear enough to see Mt. Fuji.

For further nighttime entertainment, see [this nightclub guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1e2u25w/a_music_lovers_guide_to_tokyo_nightclubs/).","def prioritise Otagi temple, I love that place. Otherwise if you are wanting to see deer I would forgo Nara as you're going to Miyajima and they're way more chill there. Depending on the weather you might want to rent an e bike for Miyajima, there's a place on the island near the ferry port & it's a great way to see more of the island minus crowds","No notes on the itinerary itself, but be aware that Jan 1-3 are usually super busy on touristy areas and temples because of  Hatsum≈çde. Plan any transports ahead of time, hotels are also more expensive those 3 days.

Miyajima is amazing, I'd recommend sleeping there if you plan to stay late to see it without the crowds.",

1mzn63n,11 Days Couple Itinerary - Critique Please,"Hi All,

After reading many reddit posts, vblogs etc I think I've settled on our itinerary for our Japan first visit in November.

**Questions I'd like answered please:**

\- Please could I have a sense check as to whether we are being overly ambitious with our travelling in particular? 

\- Are we missing anything - there is probably some activities to flash out in Tokyo / Kyoto so very much open to suggestions.

\- My primary target is to experience autumn foliage, mix of touristic places and some off beat places. Have included some onsens visit basically relax and recharge 

\- Earlier I was considering Shuzenji (Izu) instead to Hakone but couldn't find any decent day-use onsen but Hakone has many.

\- Should I slip Hakone or Kamakura and add one more day to Tokyo?

, I had a pretty similar itinerary n I was too tired after day 8-9 to do anything,
But maybe dats just me","Nice route and late Nov is peak foliage. You‚Äôre not wildly over-ambitious, but a few tweaks will save energy. Forward your big bags and travel to Kawaguchiko with daypacks, then forward again Kyoto to Tokyo before Hakone. Kawaguchiko: do Chureito at sunrise, Oishi Park, lakeside cycling if it is calm, and only keep both Kawaguchiko mornings if the view is promising. Use [isfujivisible.com](http://isfujivisible.com) to scan the week and grab the day that looks clear. It saves you from guessing.



Kyoto looks strong for leaves. T≈çfuku-ji, Eikan-d≈ç, Nanzen-ji, and Kiyomizu night lighting are all great. The Kibune to Kurama trek is lovely but can eat a half day, swap to Arashiyama at dawn with Okochi Sans≈ç if you want a lighter option. Himeji plus Osaka in one day works if you start early; otherwise drop Himeji and give that time to Kyoto foliage.



Big win on logistics. After Kyoto, do one night in Hakone, then go straight to Tokyo and make Kamakura and Enoshima a day trip from Tokyo instead of sleeping there. It cuts one pack-unpack and keeps the finish smooth. For onsens, Hakone has lots of easy day-use options, so you do not need two heavy onsen days unless you really want them.","I myself would not head to Kawaguchiko on a three-day holiday weekend.

Your first day looks too ambitious to me: it's likely (a) you'll be tired from the trip and (b) if you haven't been to Japan before, you'll have trouble orienting yourselves. As for 'experienc\[ing\] the iconic Shibuya Crossing', it essentially means crossing the street: it's an intersection.

Note that sunset on 30 November is at 4:28 PM in Tokyo, which means you should get an early start to Kamakura if you're planning to be on the beach in Enoshima at that time.",,
1mzx8xo,14-Day Japan Itinerary - Help Needed,"Hello! I'm hoping to get some final advice on an itinerary for my Japan trip. Me and my partner have never been before. I've spent a lot of time looking at youtube videos, reading this page, as well as getting recommendations from family and friends who have traveled to Japan before. Just hoping to catch something on the itinerary that looks awful that maybe I'm not aware of. Right now I'm aware that we have a lot of open space during our time in Tokyo that isn't really filled. Looking for a healthy blend of established plans/activities and then being able just to free ball when we might be interested in something.  We're also trying to keep costs down reasonably as we're both on a student budget. Open to any feedback and recommendations, thank you!!

",https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1mzx8xo/14day_japan_itinerary_help_needed/,"Though I've lived in Tokyo for more than 35 years, I went to the Oi flea market for the first time on this past Saturday: it's a fine one and, for many things, the prices are reasonable and a *lot* lower than typical prices at Shimokitazawa, which can be literally laughably high. (At least I literally laughed aloud at the equivalent of US$50 for a worn \[and ugly\] t-shirt that was handed out for free in my hometown.)

Gotokuji Temple is both far away from Senso-ji and not really a cat temple: it's promoted as such by the local merchants' association to try to draw traffic to the shopping street most people have to pass through to get to the mundane temple. Instead, go the next day to Imado Shrine (a bit north of Senso-ji), which is an actual cat place.

Finally, Kappabashi is about 150 to 200 meters away from Sensoji and Nakamise. You would probably do well to just plan on going to all three places on the same day.","I go to Japan every year and reading the subreddit helps me avoid places that are crowded and overhyped.

So yes I encourage everyone here to continue to go to the same spots, please don't venture out from these places so the rest of the city is still manageable!",,,
